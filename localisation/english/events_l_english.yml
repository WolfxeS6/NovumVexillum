By 2010, opinion polls routinely suggested that Labor would not be able to win the next election if it continued on this path. According to ABC's 7:30 Report', the seeds for Gillard to challenge candidate Rudd were sown by "Victorian Right factional heavyweights" Bill Shorten MP and Senator David Feeney, who had between them secured the support of "New South Wales power broker" Mark Arbib. Feeney and Arbib discussed the matter of a potential leadership challenge with Gillard on the morning of 23 June and began a numbers count to establish the feasibility of a leadership challenge. The pair found that there was more than enough support for Gillard for the challenge to proceed. The declining ratings for both the Labor Party and Rudd personally were attributed to many factors, including problems with the Home Insulation Program, a significant delay to a planned carbon emissions reduction scheme, a move to introduce mandatory internet filtering, the proposed introduction of the Resource Super Profits Tax, and the election of Tony Abbott as Leader of the Opposition. Senior Labor MPs conceded that the ALP's primary vote had dropped below 30% in some key marginal seats, a figure which if replicated at a federal election would have seen a Labor defeat."

Former state minister Alannah MacTiernan reported a consistent message from voters at doorstops that they would not vote for federal Labor later in the year, and called for Gillard to accept that she could not win an election and to stand down. Later in March, amid criticism of Gillard's handling of media law reform proposals—called "shambolic" by a key crossbencher—Chief Whip Joel Fitzgibbon confirmed that Labor Party members were "looking at the polls and expressing concerns". On 21 March at 1pm AEDST, former Labor leader Simon Crean called for a spill of all leadership positions and announced that he would support Kevin Rudd for leader and would himself stand for the deputy leadership. He was critical of Gillard and treasurer Wayne Swan for not communicating effectively with voters.

By 10 June 2013, the security of Gillard's position as leader was plunged into doubt following the loss of significant support in the Labor caucus, as well as persistently bad opinion polling that indicated Labor could be left with the low number of 40 seats in the House of Representatives. ABC News reported that "some former staunch supporters" now held the view that Gillard could not win the upcoming election, and ABC journalist Barrie Cassidy identified former Leader Kevin Rudd as the only feasible replacement. The political editor of The Australian newspaper, Dennis Shanahan, reported on 10 June that Rudd had been "mobbed" by members of the public in Geelong on 7 June 2013, and that he was "expected to be returned to the ALP leadership". On 26 June, rumours began to spread that supporters of Rudd were circulating a caucus petition calling for a vote to challenge Gillard for the leadership. In an interview with Sky News Australia that afternoon, Gillard told interviewer David Speers that she had not seen the rumoured petition, and jokingly called it the "political equivalent of the Loch Ness Monster". She also said that nobody had approached her to advise they intended to challenge her. Gillard then proceeded to call a leadership election for 7:00pm that evening in order to end the speculation, declaring that she would retire from politics if she lost, and called on any potential challenger to make the same commitment.Kevin Rudd announced in a press conference shortly afterwards that he would challenge Gillard for the leadership, and committed to retiring from politics if he lost."

The new rules make it more difficult to change leaders and require a ballot of the party membership on contested leadership spills. The new rules encourage the parliamentary party to only nominate one candidate, to avoid a month-long ballot of the general party membership.

Nominations opened at a parliamentary party meeting on Friday 13 September 2013, and remained open for a week. Anthony Albanese and Bill Shorten formally nominated.

After the Liberal Party meeting concluded, Abbott made a televised statement in which he said that 'The Liberal Party has dealt with the spill motion and now this matter is behind us'. Michelle Grattan, writing in The Conversation, argued that the 'narrow margin' of the vote left the party Leader 'deeply vulnerable to later destabilisation'.

 britain_decision.1.d:0 "The Falkland Islands have been a point of contention between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Argentina for decades, with Argentina formally laying claim to the island archipelago (as well as neighboring South Georgia) in 1833.\n\nThe Falklands were first colonized by France in 1764 with a settlement on the eastern island, which was joined by a British settlement on the western one in 1766. However, the island group was granted to Spain the same year and the British colonists left eight years later. Spain formally stopped colonial investments in the island group in 1811 in the context of the Napoleonic Wars and the threat of independence movements - including the Argentinian one - in Latin America.\n\nThe Argentinians took the Falklands (calling them 'Islas Mavlinas' in Spanish) in 1820, establishing a settlement there. The UK returned to the archipelago in 1833 by establishing a naval outpost and naming it a colony in 1837 - much to the dismay of the Argentinians. Since then, the Falklands were under continued British rule with an ever-increasing amount of British settlers - up until April 2nd, 1982, when Argentina's military junta tried to fight popular discontent with the government with an external political victory - the occupation of the Falklands. The British government responded (much to the surprise of Argentina) with military action. The subsequent Falkland War ended on June 20th with total British victory and a return to the status quo ante bellum.\n\nThe Argentinians were not deterred and still claim the islands even after the end of their junta. There is really no reason why they should be Argentinian, but having a country that owes Britain a favor could be good in the long run..."

The plane went on an odyssey that was highly traumatizing and exhausting to the 176 passengers and 15 crew members held hostage.\n\nAfter touching down in Amritsar, Lahore and Dubai, the plane was finally brought to Kandahar, a Taliban-controlled city in Afghanistan. While the hijackers had left 27 hostages go in Dubai due to various and not always clear reasons, they also stabbed one of them, Rupan Katyal, to death. The aim of the islamist terrorists that apparently belonged to the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen network was to free high-ranking Islamists imprisoned in India.\n\nThe Indian government successfully negotiated for the freedom of the hostages.

 mauritania.1.d:0 "President [Root.GetLeader]'s Conference on Inclusive Dialogue was inaugurated today with significant fanfare. The conference rallied members of the ruling party and moderate opposition, while the radical opposition refused to take part. Observers expect this conference to begin a chain of events leading to constitutional reform sponsored by the President itself, which some call a direct pathway to irreversible dictatorship in Mauritania."
 mauritania.1.o1:0 "Interesting."
 mauritania.2.t:0 "New Flag Proposal"
 mauritania.2.d:0 "Our ruling party has proposed to amend the national flag by the addition of a thin red stripe at the top and bottom. These stripes symbolise the efforts and sacrifices that the people of Mauritania will keep consenting, to the price of their blood, to defend their territory. The proposal was part of a more general project of institutional reform presented during the Conference on Inclusive Dialogue. [Root.GetLeader]'s proposed reform also included the adoption of a new national anthem and the proclamation of a 'Second Republic'."
 mauritania.2.o1:0 "An excellent initiative."
 mauritania.3.t:0 "DNI Ends With Agreement"
 mauritania.3.d:0 "The National Inclusive Dialogue has ended with an agreement by the government and moderate opposition to call for a referendum, something that has been sought since 2010. Back then the proposal didn't necessarily include a flag change for Mauritania, but was instead purely based on removing the Senate, two limit terms and 75 age limit for the presidency. Currently, the referendum to pass proposals put forward at the Conference is slated for late 2016, but if the National Assembly has trouble going forward, it could be pushed into 2017."

 mauritania.4.d:0 "Leaders of the Mauritanian opposition parties, whether they are members of the National Forum for Democracy and Unity, the Rally of Democratic Forces or the National Union for Democracy, announced the boycott of our approaching referendum. The decision was revealed just yesterday during a joint press conference. Now scheduled for early 2017, the national vote seeks approval of several decisions taken during the political dialogue, itself boycotted by the overwhelming majority of opposition parties. Mauritanians are called upon, among others, to advise on the abolition of the Senate and certain institutions, the creation of regional councils and changes to national symbols."
 mauritania.4.o1:0 "Disgraceful."
 mauritania.5.t:0 "Referendum Cancelled"
 mauritania.5.d:0 "Announced with great pomp by President [Root.GetLeader] himself, the popular referendum to approve constitutional changes contained in the resolutions of the national inclusive dialogue from October will ultimately not take place. These changes included radical moves to abolish the senate, create decentralised regional councils and modify the flag and national anthem. This change of high importance, revealed at the end of a meeting between the President and senators still arouses a stir. Thus, in place of popular consultation, the Mauritanian authorities decided to limit themselves to the vote of the Parliament sitting in congress to validate the reforms. This decision is motivated mostly by a supposedly 'difficult economic situation', a truth that the President himself now seems to recognise."
 mauritania.5.o1:0 "To Parliament it is then."
 mauritania.6.t:0 "Debate Begins in National Assembly"
 mauritania.6.d:0 "The debate on constitutional changes has begun in our lower house, the National Assembly.

 mauritania.8.d:0 "The National Assembly in its plenary session yesterday, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Mohamedould Boilil, adopted by secret vote Constitutional Bill 118/17, revising the 1991 constitution of Mauritania and its amending texts. During the debate, members of our lower house discussed the legality of the proposed revision, the national flag 'improvements', the abolition of the Senate and various other amendments that President [Root.GetLeader] and his ruling party hope to enact sooner rather than later. For our head of state, this is certainly a great victory. However, the bill must still pass through the Senate or else it will surely go to a national referendum as initially suggested."

 mauritania.9.d:0 "Mauritania's senate rejected a contentious constitutional amendment on its own abolition and the alteration of the national flag to better represent those who battled for independence from France. 33 Senators out of 56 voted against the package, the President of the Senate stated not long ago. The rejection comes after lawmakers in our lower house passed the proposed measures more than a week ago, with full support from the ruling party. The amendment is therefore definitively defeated by the upper house, and hence it is up to the President to decide whether to continue by way of a referendum."

The proposal to modify the constitution, which has been in force since 1991, was approved by lawmakers in the lower house but rejected by senators earlier this month. 'Due to this rejection, we have arrived at an impasse. But there is one way out: we will hold a referendum', said President [Root.GetLeader] at a press conference. The government has a majority in both chambers, but 24 ruling party senators voted against the measure, highlighting what the President said was a 'dysfunction in our democracy'."
 mauritania.10.o1:0 "To the polls it is!"
 mauritania.11.t:0 "Referendum Campaign Begins"
 mauritania.11.d:0 "President [Root.GetLeader] launched a campaign on Friday for a constitutional referendum boycotted by opposition figures who call the vote a smokescreen to keep the ruling party in power. The boycott movement draws broad political support from Islamists and anti-slavery activists, all of whom oppose measures including abolishing the Senate and changing the national flag. More than 1.4 million Mauritanians are eligible to vote on the constitutional changes, set to be voted on very soon."
 mauritania.11.o1:0 "Ok."
 mauritania.12.t:0 "Referendum Succeeds"
 mauritania.12.d:0 "On a turnout of 53.73 percent of the 1.4 million Mauritanians eligible to vote, 85 percent yesterday voted 'yes' to abolition of the Senate and changes to the country's flag, the national electoral commission said today. President Aziz said the changes would bring our nation 'peace, security, stability and development' and said the boycott movement existed 'only on paper and social media'. The opposition has stated it would not recognise the results of this referendum, denouncing it in a statement today as an electoral farce, also adding that people had 'rejected the constitutional amendments'. Nevertheless, the ruling party's goal has finally been achieved and Mauritania can be placed back on the path of progress towards a stronger future amongst countless threats."

Bondevik's government tried to prevent the construction of environmentally unfriendly and unsustainable energy sources, whereas the opposition of social democrats and hardline conservatives had supported the construction project.\n\nBondevik's government, due to its minority status, lost the motion of confidence that inevitably ensued and Kjell Magne Bondevik was forced to resign as Prime Minister of Norway.

Assad continued to conduct meetings, traveling abroad occasionally; he visited Moscow in July 1999. Because of his increasing seclusion from state affairs, the government became accustomed to working without his involvement in day-to-day affairs. In June 2000, at the age of 69, Hafez al-Assad died of a heart attack while on the telephone with Lebanese prime minister Hoss. 40 days of mourning was declared in Syria and 7 days in Lebanon thereafter."
