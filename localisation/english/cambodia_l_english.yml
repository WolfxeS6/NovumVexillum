 POLITICS_HUN_SEN_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 5th August 1952, in Peam Kaoh Sna, Stung Trang, Kampong Cham, French Indochina\n§YPolitical Career:§! An officer in Khmer Rouge, the communist regime that controlled Cambodia during the Cold War, Hun Sen was able to control Cambodia's government, which has been in turmoil since the 1980s.\n\nBut After Cambodia's communist government collapsed, Hun Sen was defeated by the Royalist Party, FUNCINPEC, in elections under UN supervision. However, he refused to admit his election defeat. Hun Sen declared that he was prepared to wage a civil war instead of ceding power, and FUNCINPEC had to accept a compromise of 'coalition government' with Hun Sen.\n\nBut the coalition with royalists did not last long. If he could take power alone, he was ready to do so. The 1997 coup immediately removed FUNCINPEC's influence from the government. There is still a formal monarch, the 'House of Norodom', in Cambodia. But now the 'real' king of Cambodia is Hun Sen. All the power in Cambodia comes from him, and the royalists are hiding in the dark."
 POLITICS_Norodom_Ranariddh_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 2nd January 1944, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, French Indochina\n§YPolitical Career:§! Prince Norodom Ranariddh, unlike his father, King Sihanouk, who 'practically' uses every ideology from communism to hardline right, is far more moderate and has a stronger conviction of democracy. An academic who studied law in France, Ranariddh could live a comfortable and wealthy life as a law professor at the University of Provence in France if he wanted. Giving up his professor job and fighting against dictatorships would not bring him any wealth or honor. But he entered the jungle for suffering Cambodians, and joined FUNCINPEC.\n\nHe had high public support in a democratized Cambodia, but Hun Sen's 1997 coup completely destroyed his political career. But after the brutal dictatorship of Hun Sen completely collapsed, he was finally able to take power as the prime minister of a free Cambodia.\n\nEstablishing democracy and freedom in Cambodia won't be easy. But he knows that dictatorship doesn't last forever. He has absolute power in Cambodia, but he knows that one day he will have to give up this absolute power. And it will truly be a day when Cambodia is revived."
 POLITICS_Norodom_Sihanouk_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 31st October 1922, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, French Indochina\n§YPolitical Career:§! It is difficult to define Norodom Sihanouk in one sentence. He was a Cambodian independence activist and king of Cambodia, at some times a communist leader and president, when he lost power, he defected to DPR Korea and became Kim Il-sung's trustworthy friend. Is he a monarchist? Or is he a nationalist? Or is he a Marxist? or Is he a Jucheist? The important thing is that he used all those ideologies very 'practically'.\n\nAmid the chaotic political situation in Cambodia, he is ready to pull out all the cards he could use in order to survive. The two cards, communism and the monarchism, don't seem to match each other, but he learned that they mix better than he thought in Pyongyang.\n\nThe brutal dictatorship of Hun Sen collapsed, and Sihanouk had another chance. He still remembers the various knowledge he learned while in exile. And his experimental rule, which combined a socialist economy with a hereditary monarchy, began. Can this succeed? He would say \"yes.\""
