Because we don't have the money to buy the latest expensive trains, transportation networks across the country have to rely on steam locomotives for the time being.\n\nHowever, some things can be repaired by investing a small amount of money right away. It's a railroad track. which has been neglected for decades since the 1930s, conservation of our railroad tracks is terrible. Most railway sections are short of parts, as DPR Koreans, who were impoverished by the famine of the 1990s, have been stealing parts of the railroad tracks one by one and selling them as scrap metal. Wooden railway sleepers are uncontrolled and rotting away, and intact railway sleepers are subject to theft by residents.\n\nWe will invest our budget, re-lay the railway sleeper on the railways, and re-install the missing steel parts."

Because there are no more trees in the mountain, landslides often occur in villages below the mountain when it rains.\n\nIt's impossible to get many mountains back to normal with our budget, but at least large and important mountains close to the city can be restored.

He continued to use the Soviet name Yuri Irsenovich Kim until 1960 but changed his name to Kim Jong-il when he decided to live in DPR Korea. He became a member of the WPK in 1961 and, along with his father, Kim Il-sung, began working as a DPR Korean politician.\n\nHe began to influence DPR Korean politics in earnest, leading the Three Great Revolutions in 1973. Kim Jong-il argued that revolution was needed in three areas: thought, technology, and culture allowing the WPK to take more direct control of agriculture, industry, and administrative agencies. The revolution of the 1970s made the DPR Korean regime more autocratic and oppressive, while at the same time making Kim Jong-il more influential in DPR Korean politics. When Kim Il-sung died in 1994, he became the de facto ruler of DPR Korea. DPR Korea's legal leader was President Kim Yong-nam, but Kim Yong-nam did not influence the military.\n\nKim Jong-il's succession to power was tolerated by civilians who worshiped the Kim dynasty as a 'living god', but it was perceived by intellectuals and politicians as abnormal. Then, in the 1990s, the collapse of the Soviet Union led to the disappearance of financial aid from communist countries, which led to famine in DPR Korea. This has sparked opposition to Kim Jong-il within DPR Korea. In 1997, Kim Jong-il began a purge of intellectuals and politicians who opposed him, and massacres called Simhwajo Purge were widespread throughout DPR Korea.\n\nThere is no any public opposition to Kim Jong-il dictatorship under the influence of the Simhwajo Purge. However, the continued slaughter is also increasing the number of generals in the military who are skeptical of Kim Jong-il. Whether Kim Jong-il's dictatorship can continue, or there will be a revolution to end his dictatorship. It is not yet known."

He continued to use the Soviet name Yuri Irsenovich Kim until 1960, but changed his name to Kim Jong-il when he decided to live in DPR Korea. He became a member of the WPK in 1961 and, along with his father, Kim Il-sung, began working as a DPR Korean politician.\n\nHe began to influence DPR Korean politics in earnest, leading the Three Great Revolutions in 1973. Kim Jong-il argued that revolution was needed in three areas: thought, technology, and culture, allowing the WPK to take more direct control of agriculture, industry, and administrative agencies. The revolution of the 1970s made the DPR Korean regime more autocratic and oppressive, while at the same time making Kim Jong-il more influential in DPR Korean politics. When Kim il-sung died in 1994, he became the de facto ruler of DPR Korea. DPR Korea's legal leader was President Kim Yong-nam, but Kim Yong-nam had no influence over the military.\n\nKim Jong-il's succession to power was tolerated by civilians who worshipped the Kim dynasty as a 'living god', but it was perceived by intellectuals and politicians as abnormal. Then, in the 1990s, the collapse of the Soviet Union led to the disappearance of financial aid from communist countries, which led to famine in DPR Korea. This has sparked opposition to Kim Jong-il within DPR Korea. In 1997, Kim Jong-il began a purge of intellectuals and politicians who opposed him, and massacres called Simhwajo Purge were widespread throughout DPR Korea.\n\nThere is no longer any public opposition to Kim Jong-il's dictatorship under the influence of the Simhwajo Purge. However, the continued slaughter is also increasing the number of generals in the military who are sceptical of Kim Jong-il. Whether Kim Jong-il's dictatorship can continue, or there will be a revolution to end his dictatorship. It is not yet known."
