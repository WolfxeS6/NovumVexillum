 italy.17.t:0 "Illegal Immigration Crisis"
 italy.17.d:0 "There has been an increase of illegal immigration from Northern Africa in the last years. While it offers us more workforce and therefore population in our country, which is suffering from the stagnant birth rate, it also worries a part of our population who thinks that we shouldn't save them from the seas, but instead, we should send them back from their country of origin."

 italy.24.t:0 "The Salerno-to-Reggio Calabria Motorway"
 italy.24.d:0 "After more than 50 years of works, the Salerno-to-Reggio Calabria Motorway has opened! The motorway underwent heavy modernisation, and in many cases a completely new parallel motorway was built alongside the original one and involved in most cases a complete rebuilding or replacement of the road where the alignment was retained.

 italy.28.t:0 "Criminals sabotage our industries!"

 italy.28.o1:0 "We need to step back"
 italy.28.o2:0 "More reasons to cancel them from the face of the earth!"
 italy.29.t:0 "Criminals sabotage our military industries!"
 italy.29.d:0 "Once again, an attack on our industries took place, as well as bomb attacks on buses and trains.

 italy.30.t:0 "Corruption between our politicians!"

 italy.30.o2:0 "We are almost there, they won't stop us now!"
 italy.31.t:0 "Criminals sabotage our military!"
 italy.31.d:0 "Not even the military was saved from the mean sabotages. High-ranked generals threaten to resign after criminality manages to stop supplies from reaching our army bases, and our army is demoralized. Wh can say for certain though that the last remains of the Mafia will soon be arrested and put on process, we are likely to achieve victory soon."
 italy.31.o1:0 "We are still in time to stop now!"
 italy.31.o2:0 "Success is behind the corner!"
 italy.32.t:0 "The end of organized criminality!"
 italy.32.d:0 "Since decades their shady businesses were allowed to take place, but no more will something like this happen!

Italy is now Mafia-free, no longer will our population, especially in southern Italy, suffer because of them."
 italy.32.o1:0 "This is a historical day for Italy!"
 italy.34.t:0 "House of Freedom Votes for Candidate"
 italy.34.de:0 "As the 2001 elections approach, the House of Freedom coalition, a center-right political alliance in Italy, must decide on their candidate to lead the nation.

Party leaders, delegates, and supporters from across the country converge to deliberate and vote on who will represent their vision for Italy's future. \n\nWho will emerge as the standard-bearer of the coalition? Will it be the charismatic media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, known for his promises of economic reform and modernization? Or will a dark horse candidate rally the coalition around a new face?"
 italy.34.a:0 "Media magnate Silvio Berlusconi is chosen."

 italy.34.c:0 "Umberto Bossi sweet talks his way into the candidacy."
 italy.34.d:0 "With no agreement being made, the coalition looks for a compromise candidate."
 italy.35.t:0 "A House Disunited"
 italy.35.de:0 "After intense deliberation and heated debates, the House of Freedom coalition finds itself at a standstill. The decision to select a compromise candidate aims to maintain unity within the diverse alliance. The three leading contenders for this role—Pier Ferdinando Casini, Giorgio La Malfa, and Gianni De Michelis—each bring unique strengths and visions to the table. However, an unexpected proposal to include the far-right Fiama Tricolore party, with Pino Rauti as their candidate, adds a controversial twist to the proceedings."
 italy.35.a:0 "The moderate Pier Ferdinando Casini is chosen as a unifing candidate."
 italy.35.b:0 "Unlikely candidate Giorgio La Malfa gets chosen."
 italy.35.c:0 "Social democrat Gianni De Michelis is chosen to appeal to the left."
 italy.35.d:0 "Controversially, Pino Rauti joins the coalition as its candidate."
 italy.36.t:0 "The Olive Tree Votes for Candidate"
 italy.36.de:0 "As Italy approaches election day, the center-left Olive Tree coalition must now choose their candidate to lead the country. Comprised of the Democratic Party of the Left, Italian People's Party, and various other center-left parties, the Olive Tree coalition aims to present a united front against their center-right rivals. Delegates from across the nation gather in a spirited assembly, filled with debates and discussions on who should carry their banner. \n\nAmong the potential candidates are Francesco Rutelli, the dynamic Mayor of Rome; Massimo D'Alema, an experienced and influential former Prime Minister; and Enrico Boselli, a respected statesman."
 italy.36.a:0 "Charismatic moderate Francesco Rutelli is chosen."
 italy.36.b:0 "Experienced D'Alema convinces the coalition."
 italy.36.c:0 "Enrico Boselli is chosen to help unify the left wing of the party."
 italy.36.d:0 "The internal is unsucessful, a compromise candidate must be chosen."
 italy.37.t:0 "A Withering Tree"
 italy.37.d:0 "The Olive Tree coalition, after rigorous debate and consideration, finds itself in need of a compromise candidate to maintain unity and appeal across its diverse factions. The coalition, which includes a broad spectrum of center-left parties, must balance the varied interests and priorities of its members. Three distinct candidates emerge as potential unifying figures, \n\nGrazia Francescato of the Federation of the Greens, a prominent environmentalist, and Oliviero Diliberto from the Communist Refoundation Party, which would bring a strong leftist perspective. In a surprising move, the coalition could also choose Luis Durnwalder, a respected leader of the South Tyrolean People's Party. This would signal a commitment to regional autonomy and minority rights, broadening the coalition’s appeal."
 italy.37.a:0 "The progressive Grazia Francescato will represent the coalition."
 italy.37.b:0 "Shockingly, Luis Durnwalder is elected as candidate."
 italy.37.c:0 "In a pivot to the left, communist Oliviero Diliberto is chosen."
 italy.38.t:0 "2001 Elections!"
 italy.38.d:0 "The 2001 Italian general election is upon us, marking a pivotal moment in the nation's history. The two main political coalitions, the center-right House of Freedom and the center-left Olive Tree, are vying for support amongst the population, with each coalition having put forward a candidate who represents their vision and policies for the future of Italy. \n\nThe election is expected to be fiercely contested, with both coalitions rallying their supporters and striving to sway undecided voters."
 italy.38.a:0 "The House of Freedom sweeps the election!"
 italy.38.b:0 "Against all predictions, the Olive Tree stands victorious!"
 italy.39.t:0 "Eurocommunist Rallies in [Root.GetNameDef]!"
 italy.39.desc:0 "There's been a serious increase in protests, riots and rallies in recent weeks, specially from the communist and socialist parties. Our intelligence services suspect that [ITA.GetNameDef] has some part in this, specially considering its increasing Eurocommunist rethoric. \n\nWhatever the case may be, these protests are destabilizing our society, and we must decide how to respond."
 italy.39.a:0 "Let them tire themselves out."
 italy.39.b:0 "Arrest the agitators."
 italy.39.c:0 "Send in the tanks!"
