Young people are too poor, and lack the wealth to raise and educate their children. The lack of jobs for young people is also pointed out as the reason. Some Feminists argue that it is the result of women's abortions in the 1990s. Men were considered superior to women in the traditional Korean patriarchy, and statistically, it is estimated that more than hundreds of thousands of women have killed. This has left many male populations unable to find marriage subjects and makes it impossible to increase the birth rate. And some politicians blame too long working hours. Long working hours create difficult conditions for raising children.\n\nWhat causes the low birth rate? What matters is the treatment, not the cause. Rapidly increasing the birth rate will not be possible until human cloning is invented. The most appropriate alternative is immigration."

There is no denying that New-right's post-nationalist ideology has provided a new identity for Koreans in despair.

Conservatives and the right believe that the U.S. military has better strategic capabilities than the Korean military, and that the Korean military led by the U.S. military generals is superior militarily to the Korean military led by the Korean generals. However, liberals and leftists believe that Korea should protect its own country.\n\nAnd National Bolshevists, including the NL, claim that the U.S. control of South Korea's military is undeniable evidence that Korea is the 'colonial' of the U.S. Whatever the facts, the issue of Wartime Operational Control is still a political contention."

In Busan, South Korea's southernmost port city, television broadcasts from Japan's Tsushima Island were available.

Kim Dae-jung first abolished censorship, which was conducted in the comic books, etc. and in 1998, Korea legalised the screening of Japanese films in Korea, limited to those jointly produced by Koreans and Japanese. Kim Dae-jung, who thought that this limited culture opening policy was successful, promised to open up Japanese culture during a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.\n\nbut, Cultural isolationism cannot last forever.

However, the confrontation with other pro-democracy activists in South Korea led to different candidates, which divided the public's votes.

However, it was in 1993 that a democratic regime was actually established in Korea, and until then, civilian dictators and the Junta government had alternately ruled the country for decades. Korea was under coercive rule by various right-wing dictators for decades, and left-wing politicians who resisted they established several democratic opposition parties during the 20th century. Left-wing politicians, like Kim Dae-jung, were divided into moderates fighting in the National Assembly in lawful ways, and hardliners who want to eliminate right-wing dictators in Korea through a 'socialist revolution'.\n\nModerate democratic revolutionaries in South Korea have centre-left tendencies and have gathered around Kim Dae-jung, a pro-American politician protected by the American government. despite the military regime's attempted assassination and political obstruction, Kim Dae-jung led Korea's democratic revolution and transformed the korea into a democracy in the 1990s. Due to the division of the Korean peninsula and various related political reasons, left-wing political parties in Korea have left-wing nationalism tendencies. As the country's left-wing parties supported racial nationalism, korean right-wingers began to focus on post-nationalism and pluralism.\n\nAs of 2000, Korea's moderate left-wing forces are divided between social conservative, including Kim Dae-jung, and those centred on Roh Moo-hyun. Korea has not seen its liberal ideology grow due to long military dictatorships, and even democratic revolutionaries often have authoritarian tendencies. but Roh Moo-hyun wants to reform Korea into a Western-style social liberal state."

Undongkwon was composed of Korean intellectuals from the 20th century, and they thought that the American supported and protected Korea's military dictatorship. They had non-aligned, socialist, and anti-imperialistic tendencies during the 20th century.\n\nUnongkwon can be divided into two main factions: NL and PD. NL mean 'National Liberation', and they are National Bolsheviks who have been strongly influenced by North Korea's Juche ideology. They became politically isolated during the 20th century, with no support from other moderates due to their racist tendencies.\n\nPD, short for 'People's Democracy', is an orthodox Marxist in Korea in the 20th century. Unlike the NL, they did not have a political obsession with nationalism. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in the late 20th century, PD gave up Marxism and changed their ideology to social democracy, unlike the NL still maintained its National Bolsheviks. Since the 1990s, PDs have chosen moderate social democracy, allowing them to work more closely with centrists. Since the 21st century, PD lawmakers such as Kwon Young-ghil and Sim Sang-jung have formed political cooperation with the centre-left on several occasions.\n\nThe genealogy of Korea's right-wing party is simple. As of 2000, the Korean right-wing 'Grand National Party' changed its name after the 'Democratic Justice Party', which was the Junta dictatorship in the 1980s, changed their name after the Democratic Revolution.

But this was because of the political impact of a decade of hell-like that lasted from the end of the 20th century to the 2010s. Korea's bankruptcy crisis in the late 20th century dealt Koreans a hard economic blow, and yet President Kim Dae-jung failed to show any vision for Korea in the 21st century in the 2000 general elections. Legalized amid political turmoil, Japanese pop culture completely dismantled Korean pop culture, and Koreans had to endure significant ideological turmoil in the early 21st century. Throughout the 20th century, Koreans were educated about the superiority of the Korean race (Minjok) by the junta. But did the Korean race really have scientific excellence? Economic turmoil, political paralysis, and the dismantling of culture have triggered Koreans in the 21st century to contemplate their identity for the first time.\n\nNew-right, a hard-line post-nationalist political faction that emerged in the early 21st century, provided an alternative historical view of Colonial Korea to dismantle existing Korean nationalism. New-right's alternative view was enthusiastic about the younger generation of Korea, which suffered from ideological turmoil, and subsequent 2nd Korean War completely destroyed Korea's Minjok racial-nationalism ideology. What kind of \"racial homogeneity\" should we have for North Korean Minjok, who kills someone's brother, parents, and children? What did \"The Great Korean Race with 5,000 Years of History\" leave Koreans? \"Great\" Korea could not give any answers.\n\nKoreans saw the despair of 2000, lost the culture of making themselves up, were slaughtered by the same \"Paedal Minjok\"(Korean Race) due to the new war, and in the 2002 presidential election, Roh Moo-hyun and his reformists, who believed they could change the future, had to see them lose the presidential election. The declaration of the founding of the Republic of Japan is not a sudden event, but a result of long-term oppression, and this is a reply from the Korean government and people in coalition with New-right to 50 years of Korean history since 1945.

The desperate political and economic situation of the past decade or so has caused young people to completely lose their sense of belonging to Korea, and the younger generation has used their culturally familiar Japan as a \"weapon\" to express their anger toward the older generation.
