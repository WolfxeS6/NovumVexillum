Many LDP-supporting local organizations are wandering around losing their owners, and newcomers to politics are wondering which political party to choose. For the DPJ to completely replace the LDP, we first need to crush the local LDP Koenkai(Group of Patrons). Koenkai supported exchanges between LDP politicians and united them with local interest groups. But because the LDP was disbanded, Pro-LDP Koenkai would have weakened. We need to create new 'Koenkai' for the DPJ, and allow them to negotiate anew with local interest groups."

But is this formal Upper House really necessary for us? We will undergo a major overhaul of the electoral district for the upper house so that it can serve as a similar function to the \"Senate\" of the United States. The House of Councillors will now be tasked with further revitalizing Japan's local autonomy, not a formal organization."

However, the damage done to Fukushima Daiichi, one of Japan's most vital nuclear reactors, is not only out of the ordinary, but absolutely catastrophic.\nIn a nuclear disaster that only Chernobyl 1986 could measure up to, the tsunami destroyed the emergency reactors that were to cool the reactors after the automatic shutdown. The Units 1, 2 and 3 suffered nuclear meltdowns, being accompanied by hydrogen-air chemical explosions and massive release of radioactive material.\n\nThe radiation emitted by the reactor was strong enough to sentence an unprotected human to death after a mere minute; the regional area thus became uninhabitable.\n\nThe catastrophe changed public opinion on nuclear power the world over."

 japan.26.desc:0 "After Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's cerebral infarction, Mikio Aoki became interim prime minister and led the government. But, the problem was that the process of his becoming interim prime minister was unclear.

There are various factions within the DPJ as well, but the biggest confrontation of the DPJ now is the confrontation between the existing politicians of the DPJ and the former LDP politicians who followed Koichi Kato. Fortunately, this political confrontation is not huge enough to completely divide the DPJ, but it is expected that it will be difficult to see politicians cooperating with each other within the DPJ for the time being."

Yamasaki is an old friend of Kato's, and he supported Kato with great enthusiasm to help him win at the time of Kato's rebellion.\n\nThe political rival against it is Ichiro Ozawa.

It was a small inconvenience at first, but it feels like it's getting worse and worse. He was told by a doctor that angina may be progressing at a hospital he visited in secret. In particular, the doctor said that it could be a sign of a relapse, as Ozawa was hospitalized for angina in 1991. the doctor cautiously asked him to resign as prime minister, needing long-term care to treat his angina problem.\n\nThe only variable is the personal character of Ichiro Ozawa, who is known to be rather impulsive. He is likely to make a hasty judgment that the doctor has made a misdiagnosis, or that he is exaggerating the risk of his disease. The need to resign as prime minister, especially to treat diseases, will certainly hurt his political clout. This fact confuses his reasonable judgment."

The cause of his death turned out to be a heart disease he had been hiding from the public. The DPJ is in considerable disarray, and the Pro-Kato faction strongly condemns Ozawa for concealing his illness until the moment of his death.

He pointed out that attempts made in China are the same as the Soviet Union's NEP (New Economic Policy), which is an important attempt to enable the socialist system to win against the market economy. In addition, Shii addressed the need to make \"neutral country Japan\" a future for Japan through the gradual dissolution of the Self-Defense Forces and the dismantling of its alliance with the USA.\n\nAfter Comrade Shii's speech, Tetsuzo Fuwa, the Chairman of the JCP, proposed to comrades that the JCP's rules be revised. The most important change was the JCP's decision to abandon the \"Vanguardism\" system. Fuwa said that JCP should not remain a \"working class vanguard party\", but \"party for the working class and all the people who want Japan's progressive\". With this revision of the party rules, the JCP abandoned all the radical ideologies that remained theoretically and became a complete democratic socialist ideology party.\n\nFinally, Kazuo Shii became the next Chairman of the JCP, replacing Tetsuzo Fuwa, who was Chairman from 1989 to 2000."

If today was 2000, someone will remember him as a member of the \"YKK\", three famous groups of friends, Yamasaki, Kato, and Koizumi, and other someone will remember him as the Kochikai faction's leader of the old LDP. Another will remember him as a moderate liberal politician who opposes Japan's far right. But most of all, he chose to go down in history as a great rebel, revolutionary, and reformer who destroyed the LDP forever, which seemed to never collapse.\n\nKato opposed the revision of the Peace Constitution (Article 9 of the Constitution) and showed caution against Japanese nationalism, thereby promoting his image as a liberal and reformer within the LDP. He did not make many enemies within the faction thanks to his gentle personal character and excellent intellectual analysis, and after the 90s he also earned the title of \"the most likely man to be prime minister\". But actually, the process of Kato becoming prime minister was a huge revolution that no one expected. After Yoshiro Mori's improper succession to the prime minister, he led lawmakers who supported him to carry out a huge gamble of leaving the LDP. With the support of the public and the help of various lawmakers, he narrowly became the new Japanese prime minister.\n\nBut not all the problems have been solved. Now that he has become prime minister as an outsider, not all members of the DPJ support him. His faction's position within the DPJ is quite precarious. But if he survives all the waves of crisis, he will be remembered as a great prime minister who truly changed Japan's history. If he can withstand the waves."

He gained power in questionable ways after Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, but has since failed to gain popularity due to inappropriate political remarks and various unexpected actions.\n\nCitizens don't know which direction Japan's future will go, but the person who comes to power after he is ousted from power will be the main character who will really lead Japan's future."
 
 POLITICS_kazuo_shii_DESC:0 "Kazuo Shii, an amateur pianist, and leader of the Japanese Communist Party, though he was the centre of many debates, even he would not have expected to become Japan's prime minister. Born to communist parents in 1954, he first experienced communist activity in 1960 when he participated in protests against the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty on his father's back. It was during his university years that he began his communist activities in earnest. He gave up his goal of being a pianist during his university years and joined the Japanese Communist Party, inheriting the goal of communizing Japan that his parents had walked.\n\nThe Japanese Communist Party was founded in 1922, but their chance to win power didn't come for more than decades. Before the Cold War, JCP was checked by the government, and during the Cold War, JCP only gained limited support from citizens. But the Japan, giant piano, is fickle, and sometimes play music that surprises everyone, like an untuned instrument. Amid outrage and outcry from numerous conservatives, Shii stepped toward the prime minister's residence. Now the piano, Japan, is in his hands, and he is ready to play new music for all Japanese; He Getting ready to play beautiful ensembles called Japan for Peace, Japan for Workers, and Japan for Social minorities including LGBT."
 
 POLITICS_Taku_Yamasaki_DESC:0 "Taku Yamasaki, one of the members of YKK, made up of Koichi Kato's friends, is an experienced politician who has been in politics for a long time since the 1960s. He won Kato's strong confidence by deciding to stay with Kato until the last minute, unlike Koizumi, who decided to betray his friend during Kato's rebellion.\n\nAlthough Kato was a reformer who gained much popularity with the young people, Yamasaki is not recognized by the public as Kato's full political successor due to morality controversy due to inappropriate relationships with several women, and a relatively right-conservative political ideology. But at least Koichi Kato believes Yamasaki will lead Japan's future in a positive direction as prime minister."
 
 POLITICS_Ichiro_Ozawa_DESC:0 "In 1967, Ichiro Ozawa entered politics at the young age of 27, earning the confidence of Kakuei Tanaka, a major politician in the LDP, and was sponsored enough to once earn the nickname \"Tanaka's precious child\". He began his political career in the LDP, and grew up in the LDP, but in 1992-1993 Japan's political turmoil forced him to make a new decision. When the LDP was in turmoil due to an alleged corruption scandal inside Japan's LDP, Ozawa left the LDP by publishing a book called the \"Japan Remodel Plan\" (Nippon Kaizo Keikaku), arguing that great reforms were needed for the whole of Japan.\n\nAfter several political parties, including the Liberal Party, he joined the Democratic Party of Japan and began his career as a full-fledged liberal politician. Although many citizens view Ozawa, who often makes mistakes because of his impulsive nature, with disbelief, he dreams of breaking down Japan's rigid bureaucracy and dismantling \"political collusion\" in which policies are decided by only a few politicians while ignoring citizens' opinions. And whether Prime Minister Ozawa will be able to fulfill that dream is only a matter of the future that is yet to be known."
 
 POLITICS_hak_ja_han_DESC:0 "Although the Unification Church had some political influence in Japan, no one seriously thought that Japan would become a theocratic nation ruled by the Unification Church. The attempt of the occult religion \"Aum Shinrikyo\" the last attempt to turn Japan into a theocratic nation, was thoroughly dismantled by the government, and the Unification Church sponsored right-wing politicians only to the extent permitted by law. But under unexpected political pressure, such as external factors, Japan is on the verge of a Christian theocratic government that has never existed before.\n\nIt is not yet known how Han, who became the first Korean leader in Japanese history, will rule Japan. But the hard-line Christians who took control of the government are already preparing to get rid of the \"communists\" inside Japan and make the country the front line of sacred anti-communism."
 
 POLITICS_shinjiro_koizumi_DESC:0 "Ridiculous comments, stupid nonsense, and incoherent ramblings. Although he is the son of Junichiro Koizumi, the Japanese prime minister, his various statements have been cited as memes, and he got the nickname 'Poem' by the Japanese public. If the English word \"Poem\" is used without translation in Japan, it contains not just the meaning of poetry, but the cynical meaning of \"a sentence that is only cool and has no meaning\". But really, does he have no political talent?\n\nObviously Shinjiro Koizumi is a bad speaker. His frequent slip of the tongue caused him to lose his reputation and be nicknamed 'Poem'. However, his poor speaking skills do not mean that he is not seriously contemplating Japan's future. He studies serious natural disaster problems, such as environmental destruction, and intends to carry out policies with the aim of \"humanity that can last until the future\".\n\nAlthough he has less experience than other politicians and is ridiculed for his eloquence, he will try to implement environmental policies that enhance the quality of life of the Japanese people as prime minister. and even if the public doesn't recognize him, nature in Japan will understand his efforts as an environmental expert."
 
 POLITICS_taro_nakayama_DESC:0 "Taro Nakayama, a politician from 1924, started his first career as a politician when he was elected in the 1955 Osaka City Council election. Based on his experience in Osaka, he was elected to the House of Councillors election in 1968 and became a senator. He spent most of his political career in the Seiwakai faction, but since breaking away from the faction in 1998, he has become an LDP politician with no political faction.\n\nTaro Nakayama is an experienced senior politician, the oldest in the Japanese parliament since 2003. He's been in politics for a very long time, but by comparison, his public profile is not relatively high. He was able to become prime minister because he was expected to be able to act as a seasoned diplomat among factions, with long political experience at a time when there was no proper winner due to the huge conflict between factions. Can his experience as foreign minister in the 1990s help in the chaotic political situation of Japan in the early 21st century? It seems true that at least several established politicians trust his ability."

 POLITICS_shigeto_nagano_defeated_DESC:0 "After 1945, once again, Japan was occupied by foreign powers. The War cabinet chose to resign, but the question was who will take over as prime minister after humiliating post-war negotiations. This role does not have any glory and will leave the worst scars on a political career. After most famous politicians expressed reluctance, an old general, and retired former lawmaker Shigeto Nagano was called back. A special law was passed to appoint him as a member of the House of Councillors who does not have the right to vote, in order to circumvent the law that only a sitting member of the National Diet can be prime minister, and he became the new prime minister through a perfunctory process.\n\nHe is already a politician who retired in 1998 and is increasingly forgotten by modern Japanese. The public's perception of him would be that he resigned from the Minister of Justice due to political controversy after claiming that Japan did not commit the Nanjing Massacre during World War II. That's why some hard-liners expect him to show a tough stance in peace negotiations, or to direct guerrilla activities inside Japan and show a §RFinal Resistance.§!\n\n"No more," Shigeto Nagano says.\n\nHe is a right-wing nationalist, a former general, and believes in Japan's great glory. But at the same time, he is a politician who has been involved in establishment politics since the 1980s and has had a number of serious discussions about what role Japan should play in maintaining peace in East Asia at the end of the Cold War. Although he is a hardliner right-wing who rejects foreigners, he will not let any more meaningless blood flow."
 
 POLITICS_interim_government_defeated_DESC:0 "After 1945, once again, Japan was occupied by foreign powers. The War cabinet chose to resign, but the question is who will take over as prime minister after humiliating post-war negotiations. This role does not have any glory and will leave the worst scars on a political career. Eventually, Taro Nakayama, an old politician about to retire, was chosen as the prime minister of the interim government. In order to save Japan from losing the war and suffering from political turmoil, he is facing his last challenge in life."
 
 POLITICS_shinkun_haku_minjok_defeated_DESC:0 "When Japan colonized Korea in 1910, no one would have expected Korea to take over Japan after the first century. But it's happened, and the Japanese are terrified. Especially due to Korea's racial nationalist \"Minjok\" ideology, the possibility of Japanese people being considered to be 'inferior' being subject to Korea's extremely coercive rule is raised. The War cabinet chose to resign, but the question was who would take over as prime minister after humiliating post-war negotiations. This role does not have any glory and will leave the worst scars on a political career. Eventually, Shinkun Haku, a Korean immigrant politician, led the post-war cabinet.\n\nBorn of mixed Korean and Japanese descent, Haku is familiar with Korean culture due to his Korean father and has a background as the head of the Japanese branch of Chosun Ilbo, the most famous media company in Korea, so he also has several acquaintances in Korea. Thanks to his career, he was classified as a reliable negotiator.\n\nHaku sat at the negotiating table, using the name 'Baek Jinhoon', his previous name before naturalizing as a Japanese citizen, in order to appear as familiar as possible to Korean negotiators. At least hoping his hard work will impress Koreans. because his negotiations do not work well, Koreans' Minjok ideology will surely burn down the Japanese archipelago completely."
 
 POLITICS_shinkun_haku_defeated_DESC:0 "When Japan colonized Korea in 1910, no one would have expected Korea to take over Japan after the first century. But it's happened, One hope is that with the legalization of Japanese culture in 2000, the popular culture of Koreans has been replaced by Japanese culture, and most Koreans are no longer hostile to Japan. The War cabinet chose to resign, but the question was who would take over as prime minister after humiliating post-war negotiations. This role does not have any glory and will leave the worst scars on a political career. Eventually, Shinkun Haku, a Korean immigrant politician, led the post-war cabinet.\n\nBorn of mixed Korean and Japanese descent, Haku is familiar with Korean culture due to his Korean father and has a background as the head of the Japanese branch of Chosun Ilbo, the most famous media company in Korea, so he also has several acquaintances in Korea. Thanks to his career, he was classified as a reliable negotiator.\n\nAlthough many Korean negotiators have expressed cultural homogeneity toward Japan, saying they have also enjoyed Japan's \"Anime\" and \"J-POP\", Haku remains alert in conversations with Korean negotiators. No matter how much they love Japan culturally, there is still the possibility of making a harsh decision politically."
 
 POLITICS_japanese_national_diet_defeated_DESC:0 "After Japan's defeat, the Overlord government felt the need to maintain formal democracy in Japan. This is because, although the Overlord government is quite an authoritarian government, but they maintain that it is a \"democratic\" nation externally, so establishing a blatant military junta in Japan risked international and domestic criticism.\n\nAs a result of the political compromise, Japan's parliament with no power was rebuilt. There will still be a House of Councillors and House of Representatives in Japan, and there will be a National Diet where the people vote as before. But now the National Diet is just a place for political performance. It is the military leaders who rule Japan, and the prime minister does not have any political power to issue orders to the military."
 
 POLITICS_juche_shiso_kenkyukai_defeated_DESC:0 "Juche Shiso Kenkyukai (The Juche Society), Japanese pro-Jucheists, has no political experience, no political ability, and no political influence to govern Japan. They were able to become the official leadership of Japan because the Jucheist government decided to rule the country. They're just authorized to read documents from the Overlord government and sign them."
 
 POLITICS_japanese_national_diet_pr_china_defeated_DESC:0 "The Chinese government has enjoyed using systems such as 'one country, two systems.' Chinese instruct the occupied areas to guarantee (formal) autonomy and maintain economic freedom. But never offers them political freedom. China decided to do the same for conquered Japan. The Japanese national diet will still remain, but only the Chinese president has the power to choose a candidate for prime minister. The Japanese government still insists it is free, but people around the world are watching Japan's democracy die."
 
 POLITICS_shintaro_ishihara_defeated_DESC:0 "Shintaro Ishihara, a hard-line Japanese nationalist and seasoned right-wing politician who has served as Governor of Tokyo for a long time since 1999, became the leader of Japan, which was transferred to the civilian government after political turmoil following the defeat. Ishihara dreams of reviving Japan, which has been devastated since its defeat, as a strong power capable of projecting international influence once again. Although, due to the wounds after the defeat and due to Overlord's political interference, it is expected that his dream will take some time to complete, He is determined to make any sacrifices to rebuild Japan."
