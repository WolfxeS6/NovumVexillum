 SpaceAgenciesDesc_NASA:0 "The §YNational Aeronautics and Space Administration§!, NASA was founded on 29th July 1958. NASA repeatedly lost its space race with the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War. The world's first satellite was not the United States, but the Soviet Union's Sputnik, and the world's first animal to go into space was the Soviet Union's Laika. The first human in the world to go into space was Yuri Gagarin from the Soviet Union. But that's all right. Even with 99 percent defeats, the one who won the last one will be remembered as the winner of history's space race. We lost all the other battles, but it was the Americans who got to the moon first anyway, right? Anyway, we did something that even Yuri Gagarin couldn't do. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, NASA is recognized as the world's leading space pioneer."
 
 SpaceAgenciesTradition_NASA:0 "§gThe United States Customary Units are like a symbol that separates the United States from other countries. Although almost all countries in the world except the United States use the same standardized International System of Units (SI), the United States did not accept SI such as meters and kilograms from the 20th century to the 21st century. Why should we follow weaker foreigners' SI when the United States is the most advanced country in the world? Inch, Pound, and many American Customary units are like symbols of the American Frontier Spirit that 'We don't have to follow foreigners' standards'. ...Although this is causing *some* problems in the space race.\n\nThe Mars Surveyor '98 Orbiter disaster in 1998 showed that not using SI units can create scientifically difficult situations. In 1998, the U.S. spent 320 million Dollars to launch an orbiter to explore Mars. American engineers typed in their usual American units to adjust the orbiter's orbit, but computers that were not interested in the American frontier spirit recognized this number as SI and modified the orbiter's orbit. and the 320 million dollars was lost in vain, meaningless fashion when the orbiter crashed into Mars.\n\nOur engineers now spend a lot of time converting the American customary units in documents from many American companies into 'safe' SI units and making sure that they are correct numbers. These tasks have increased NASA's workload and are consuming unnecessary budgets.§!\n§Y-----§!\nTradition Effect: [THIS.GetName]'s §YSpy Satellite Network's $MODIFIER_CONSUMER_GOODS_FACTOR$ §!: §R+50.0%§!"

 SpaceAgenciesDesc_JAXA:0 "The §YJapan Aerospace Exploration Agency§!, JAXA was founded through an early 21st century attempt to unite several space agencies, including the National Space Development Agency of Japan. Japan's space development attempts began in the 1950s. Japan, which began rebuilding after recovering from its World War II defeat, also successfully launched a Kappa rocket in 1958 and flew up to 40 kilometers in the air. After the 1960s, attempts to develop satellites began, and in 1970, the launch of Ohsumi, a satellite made with only Japanese technology, was successful. This makes Japan the fourth country in the world to have satellites, after the Soviet Union, the United States, and France. Since then, Japan's space technology has developed at a rapid speed, and gradually military research into space technology has begun. JAXA is preparing various studies today to further develop Japan's space technology."

The CASC itself was officially created in 1999, but China's rocket history began in 1956. Initially developing rockets for use as weapons, researchers at the Department of Defense found artificial satellites could be attached to these rockets instead of nuclear weapons. Compared to the two giants, the America and the Soviet Union, China's space development began much later, but we have been chasing former powers at a rapid pace. Maybe CASC can take the place of NASA in the future. ...Maybe."

Of course, nationalists who insist on leaving the European Union will not be seriously concerned about the universe. Our land is on the ground, so why do we have to worry about space?\n\nBut after leaving the EU, after being expelled from all the space services that were easily provided because they belonged to the EU, they will realize something.

Of course, after a moment of sweetness comes a bitter aftertaste. It's like getting dental treatment after eating delicious candy. The withdrawal from the European Union means that we have been excluded from all official space security services that we have received from the EUSPA. We will have to rebuild all space security services from zero. But that's all right. Brexit was an action worth it. Isn't it? The §YUnited Kingdom Space Agency§!, UKSA will try to produce a new GNSS for the UK only after leaving the EU.
