 POLITICS_SWI_FEDERAL_ASSEMBLY_DESC: "Switzerland has an extreme decentralist system that keeps individual politicians from exercising strong power. Every citizen of Switzerland has a very wide range of powers to participate directly in politics, and it can be said that it is de facto the only country in modern society that has a 'direct representation'.\n\nThe president has a one-year term, and seven people are elected at the same time. Presidents have de facto no authority, and politics in Switzerland is conducted through parliament, and through the 'federal popular initiative' of the people."
