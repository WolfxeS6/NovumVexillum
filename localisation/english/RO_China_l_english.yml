 ro_china.introgame.1.t: "The Year of the Dragon"
 ro_china.introgame.1.desc: "According to the Chinese calendar, the year 2000 is the 'Year of the Dragon'. It is also the time when China, which claims to be a dragon, gradually begins to show its enormous power out of the chaos of the 20th century. And the Year of the Dragon, the eyes of a giant dragon, is aiming for Formosa, a small island. On July 9, 1999, Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui stated that the relationship between China and Taiwan was 'state-to-state', which angered the Communist Party of China, which claimed that Taiwan was part of China.\n\nChina is trying to crush the spirit of separatism by intimidating the Taiwanese, as it did in the 1996 presidential election. Once again, the Chinese government has begun to make comments about the \"full-scale invasion of Taiwan\" and the south of China is under extreme tension."
 ro_china.introgame.1.a: "Our sword is ready to hunt the Dragon!"
 
 ro_china.introgame.2.a: "Let's make them kneel before the Dragon!"
 
 ro_china.introgame.3.t: "The Divided Kuomintang"
 ro_china.introgame.3.desc: "Ahead of the 2000 presidential election, Kuomintang is divided into two forces; Lien Chan, a legitimacial candidate backed by Lee Teng-hui, and James Soong, a non-mainstream candidate who opposes him. Lien Chan insists on the integration of China and Taiwan and considers ways for Taiwan to gain autonomy inside Chinese territory. Because it is a negative thing for Pan-Green that he gets a boost, Pan-Green political forces should expect their rival James Soong's political influence to rise and take away enough of Lien's approval rating."
 
 ro_china.introgame.3.a: "James Soong should be able to gain enough influence!"
 ro_china.introgame.3.b: "Target James Soong's weaknesses!"
 
 ro_china.introgame.4.a: "Target James Soong's weaknesses!"
 ro_china.introgame.4.b: "It is dangerous to intervene in Kuomintang Internal Confrontation."
 
 ro_china.introgame.5.t: "James Soong Under Political Attack"
 ro_china.introgame.5.desc: "Several Taiwanese internet communities simultaneously criticized James Soong and began to criticize him for destroying the Kuomintang's chances of victory. Because this move was so sudden that we could not anticipate it, politicians at the DPP suspect there was an intervention from Mainland China."
 ro_china.introgame.5.a: "There's no way they won't interfere in this election."
 
 ro_china.introgame.6.t: "James Soong's Controversy over Corruption"
 ro_china.introgame.6.desc: "Kuomintang non-mainstream candidate James Soong has been hit by a serious corruption controversy. James Soong was suspected of embezzling a lot of money from inside KMT for personal use in the past. James Soong was supported by the public because he had an image of integrity, and his corruption controversy took a toll on his political influence.\n\nThe variable is this. James Soong has seen a significant decline in his approval rating, but he still has many supporters. Even if he is confident of losing the election, his chances of winning the DPP will increase if he does not step down as a candidate by the last minute. In order for Kuomintang to win, it is necessary to force James Soong to voluntarily abandon the election. But would he agree with that?"
 ro_china.introgame.6.a: "This will be a huge variable in the election."
 
 ro_china.introgame.7.a: "For Lien Chen's victory, we may need to step in."
 
 ro_china.introgame.8.t: "James Soong to Rally his Approval Ratings Again"
 ro_china.introgame.8.desc: "James Soong is rallying his supporters again despite the corruption controversy. Although James Soong's political corruption issues have caused great controversy, the problem is Lien Chen's pro-China tendency. Lien Chen hopes that Taiwan and Mainland China will be able to reunify through the federal system, thereby gaining autonomy within China. Citizens who fear that Taiwan will be controlled by China if Lien takes power still think of James Soong as an alternative."
 ro_china.introgame.8.a: "Federal Reunification may be the answer..."
 ro_china.introgame.8.b: "Encourage supporters of Lien Chen to further support James Soong."
 
 ro_china.introgame.9.a: "Can't we assassinate James Soong?"
 ro_china.introgame.9.b: "Let's further attack the DPP and encourage Lien Chen to expand his base."
 
 ro_china.introgame.10.t: "Injured James Soong"
 ro_china.introgame.10.desc: "There was not a long time left until the election to formulate a proper assassination plan, and we had very little time left. We approached Taiwan's pro-China socialist forces and succeeded in delivering weapons to them, but the half-baked attempts of non-professional socialists only slightly hurt him. The attempt is expected to further boost James Soong's approval rating, forcing the CPC's inner circle to admit that the radical provocation was a mistake."
 ro_china.introgame.10.a: "It was an unreasonable attempt."
 
 ro_china.introgame.11.desc: "Today, a socialist young man in Taiwan fired a pistol at James Soong, who was addressing the public. The bullet grazed his shoulder, and he suffered minor injuries. The terrorist was immediately overwhelmed by Soong's supporters at the scene. Although the arrested socialist youth is using his right to remain silent, this attempt appears to have been part of the Communist Party of China's hardline election interference attempt. The attempt is expected to further boost James Soong's approval rating."
 ro_china.introgame.11.a: "Bloody Chinese..."
 
 ro_china.introgame.12.t: "Lien Chen Earning Approval Ratings"
 ro_china.introgame.12.desc: "Still, the KMT's confrontation continues, but Lien Chen's approval rating continues to recover. Lien Chen continues to campaign in many cities and talks about the importance of integration with China."
 ro_china.introgame.12.a: "The election is coming..."
 
 ro_china.introgame.13.a: "We look forward to his good performance."
 
 ro_china.introgame.14.t: "Chen Shui-bian's Speak"
 ro_china.introgame.14.desc: "DPP candidate Chen Shui-bian must choose to secure his supporters. Even if it disappoints some of his supporters, he can show an ambiguous message about independence, or he can make a tougher independence claim against China. A tougher independence claim will enthrall supporters, but will provoke the Communist Party of China."
 ro_china.introgame.14.a: "Independence is a very cautious issue."
 ro_china.introgame.14.b: "We want independence RIGHT NOW!"
 
 ro_china.introgame.15.desc: "In order not to provoke the CPC, Chen, the DPP candidate, has recently stopped making tough separatist claims. He seems to think that even if he disappoints some of his supporters, maintaining the status quo is a more appropriate option to prevent war."
 ro_china.introgame.15.a: "He made a wise choice."
 
 ro_china.introgame.16.desc: "\"We want independence. Not the future, right now!\"\n\nDPP candidate Chen Shui-bian's argument has recently become increasingly tough, and he insists the \"Republic of China\" needs to be transformed into a \"Taiwanese Republic\" as soon as possible. This angered important CPC politicians, and hardliners began to argue that Taiwan needs to be invaded immediately depending on the election results."
 ro_china.introgame.16.a: "Does he truly want a war?"
 
 ro_china.introgame.17.t: "Yuan T. Lee's Declaration of Support for the DPP"
 ro_china.introgame.17.desc: "Yuan T. Lee, a Nobel Prize in Chemistry and a celebrity in Taiwan, has officially decided to support Chen. Due to his high social influence, Chen is expected to benefit more from an election."
 ro_china.introgame.17.a: "The election is coming..."
 
 ro_china.introgame.18.a: "That's a stupid choice."
 
 ro_china.introgame.19.t: "The 2000 Taiwanese Presidential Election"
 ro_china.introgame.19.desc: "When the election first began, KMT's victory seemed most likely. However, the KMT split into two candidates, Lien Chan and James Soong, and the DPP succeeded in rallying its supporters. But there is still the possibility of KMT's last reversal. Lien Chan laughs at the DPP's hope \"independent Taiwan\", arguing that Mainland China and Taiwan should be unified as one country. Lien Chan claims it is a \"federal\" proposal, and believes Taiwanese citizens will be able to enjoy autonomy at Beijing's mercy. But if Lien Chan wins, will mainland China recognize Taiwan's self-government? Chen Shui-bian wants to protect Taiwan's democracy not at China's mercy, but on Taiwan's own. In the end, the winner will decide Taiwan's future."
 ro_china.introgame.19.a: "Chen Shui-bian! (Democratic Progressive Party)"
 ro_china.introgame.19.b: "Lien Chan! (Kuomintang)"
 #ro_china.introgame.19.c: "James Soong! (Independence)"
 
 ro_china.introgame.20.t: "The End of the History of the Republic of China"
 ro_china.introgame.20.desc: "Kuomintang's [CHI.GetLeader] finally started negotiations to unite the two divided China and bring the Chinese together in accordance with pan-nationalism. Although the separatists of the DPP continue to protest in Taipei, their resistance will be meaningless. [CHI.GetLeader] has already met [PRC.GetLeader] in Beijing, and together discussed how Taiwan can enjoy autonomy under the rule of the Kuomintang.\n\n[PRC.GetLeader] said he would arrest the DPP and other "separatist" party members at a fast pace, and instead acknowledge the autonomy of \"patriotic\" Taiwanese parties that support pan-nationalist ideologies. Although this will be the eternal end to 'Taiwan separatism', [CHI.GetLeader] chose to the reunification of a divided China. But we do not yet know how happy this future will be for the Taiwanese."
 ro_china.introgame.20.a: "We have burned the bridge, and we have no choice but to move forward."
 
 ro_china.introgame.21.a: "That's wonderful news."
 
 ro_china.introgame.22.t: "DPP's Takeover of Taiwan"
 ro_china.introgame.22.desc: "We were quite hoping for Kuomintang's victory in the presidential election, but unfortunately, because Kuomintang was split into two candidates, KMT's victory was practically impossible. Eventually, Chen Shui-bian, a DPP separatist, was elected president, and some hawks argued that Taiwan should be invaded immediately. The problem is that our navy is not fully ready yet, and we don't have enough military power to go to war with [USA.GetNameDef]. It would be necessary to liberate Taiwan, which calls itself the \"Republic of China\", but it would not be necessary to act too hastily. When we finish modernizing our armed forces, we will have a chance to liberate Taiwan."
 ro_china.introgame.22.a: "We need to prepare for the future."
 
 ro_china.introgame.23.t: "History does not End"
 ro_china.introgame.23.desc: "When this election first started, the DPP's chances of winning were not that high. However the division of the Kuomintang brought opportunities for the DPP, and the separatists were able to achieve a great victory. Mainland China is very angry about the outcome of the election, but as in 1996, it will not lead directly to war. China has yet to complete its naval modernization, and it is not ready to make military landfall on the island of Taiwan. But they're going to continue to attack Taiwan, they're going to try to sabotage our independence. We have to prepare for all risks during our four-year term..."
 ro_china.introgame.23.a: "We have burned the bridge, and we have no choice but to move forward."
 
 ro_china.introgame.1000.t: "CE 2000, The Republic of China"
 ro_china.introgame.1000.desc: "In the last year of the 20th century, the New Year has dawned in 2000. It was a dark period in Taiwan in the 20th century. It had to be under Japanese rule until 1945, and from 1945 Kuomintang's military dictatorship began. The KMT dictatorship came to an end at the end of the Cold War, but many democrats had to sacrifice themselves for the process.\n\nIn 2000, Taiwan is facing a presidential election in a few months. Chinese pan-nationalist Lien Chan, who wants to merge Taiwan with mainland China, is running as a candidate for Kuomintang and is attempting to take control of the Taiwan government. However, Lien Chan's attempt is in danger as the KMT has been split due to factional strife. Lien Chan's rival, James Soong, has left the KMT, trying to win the support of Chinese pan-nationalists.\n\nOn the other side of Lien Chan are Taiwanese separatists. They are Taiwanese nationalists who insist that Taiwan be independent of the 'Republic of China' because Taiwan is forcibly occupied by the Chinese. Taiwanese Nationalists gathered around the left-wing party DPP, and nominated Chen Shui-bian."

 ro_china.introgame.1001.t: "Pan Blue, and Pan Green (Part 1)"
 ro_china.introgame.1001.desc: "There are three main ethnic groups in Taiwan. The first is the Yuanzhumin(Taiwanese aborigine), who has lived in Taiwan since ancient times. Since the island of Taiwan has been under Chinese rule for hundreds of years, they now have only about 2 percent of the population left.\n\nBenshengren are citizens who migrated to Taiwan from mainland China before 1945. They were of Chinese descent at first, but over the centuries they lived in Taiwan, creating a new identity on the Taiwan island.\n\nWaishengren are citizens who have migrated with Kuomintang since 1945. Their numbers were not large, but during the Cold War, when Taiwan aimed to restore mainland China, they were the leading people in power.\n\nThe KMT government, which took back Taiwan in 1945, treated Benshengren and Indigenous people who lived on the island as low-ranking. Taiwan's important power was provided to Waishengren, who migrated from mainland China, and the KMT treated them as Taiwan's privileged class, including not punishing Waishengren who committed crimes on Taiwan. \n\nEventually, on February 28, 1947, a demonstration against the discriminatory treatment of the Chinese KMT government began on Taiwan Island. The Benshengren rejected the Chinese language and used the Japanese language to demand the solidarity of Taiwanese citizens, and the KMT grew to have a stronger sense of discrimination against them by seeing Benshengren using Japanese to unite nationalism. The KMT carried out a mass massacre against Benshengren on the island of Taiwan, and this mass massacre by the KMT led to the completion of Taiwan's nationalism. Taiwan is not a part of China, and the ideology that Taiwan and China became different nations was born."

 ro_china.introgame.1002.t: "Pan Blue, and Pan Green (Part 2)"
 ro_china.introgame.1002.desc: "Pan Green is a political faction that is supported by many Benshengrens. Due to Kuomintang's dictatorship and repression after 1945, Taiwanese people in Pan Green have come to think of themselves as citizens with a distinct ethnicity from the \"Chinese\", and Taiwan has come to perceive itself as a colony that has been occupied by the self-proclaimed \"Republic of China\". Pan Green aims to eventually remove 'China' from the name of Taiwan. Their goal is to become independent of the Taiwan Republic, and they want to permanently remove the influence of Chinese culture in Taiwan.\n\nPan Blue is a traditional Kuomintang supporter. They support Chinese pan-nationalism and claim that Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese civilization. During the Cold War in the 20th century, they aimed to take over mainland China led by Taiwan. But now that it has become practically impossible for Taiwan to take over mainland China, they are starting to think that incorporating Taiwan under Mainland Chinese rule is also a victory for 'Chinese pan-nationalism'..."

 ro_china.introgame.1003.desc: "Taiwan is very isolated internationally, and this is due to conflicts with Mainland China. Mainland China claims that the Taiwanese government is illegal and claims that it is occupying the island without permission. Taiwan has no right to join the United Nations and is not free to import weapons from abroad. At international sports competitions, they are forced to participate under the name 'Chinese Taipei.'\n\nTaiwan has very few friendly countries. The Vatican, the only ally of Europe, supports Taiwan because Mainland China oppresses Catholics. The U.S. attempts to unofficially protect Taiwan to keep China in check.\n\nIn Asia, Japan has a very special friendship with Taiwan. Kuomintang and other Chinese pan-nationalists are trying to distance themselves from Japan, claiming that the Japanese Empire has committed various atrocities by ruling Taiwan as a colony. However, Pan Green Taiwanese Nationalists are friendly with Japan and think that its \"war crimes\" have been fabricated by Chinese pan-nationalists, including the KMT."

 ro_china.joint_events.1.t: "The True-name Movement of Taiwan"
 ro_china.joint_events.1.desc: "The True-name movement, which can be written Zhèngmíng in Mandarin, or Chiàⁿ-miâ in Taiwanese, is a move to stop using the incorrect name \"China\" in Taiwan. Throughout the 20th century, the \"Republic of China's\" government in Taiwan used the name 'China' to name all the important facilities in the country. However, this was considered a very misnomer by Taiwanese separatists. Since Taiwan had to become the 'Taiwan Republic' with a different identity from China, it was considered unreasonable to use China as the name of its organization. Following this move, the DPP began the process of removing the name 'China' one by one from various government names. In the long run, it aims to go beyond simple name changes, teaching Chinese history as foreign history in textbooks, and lastly changing the country's name."
 ro_china.joint_events.1.a: "Taiwanese should be able to use the right name."
 
 ro_china.joint_events.2.t: "[CHI.GetName]'s Soft Power"
 ro_china.joint_events.2.desc: "Taiwanese Popular culture, which can be called Taiwan's Soft Power, can be analyzed as a combination of two countries' cultures; China and Japan. Taiwan's indigenous people already make up a small percentage of the population, and most of the country's population has become Han People. Han People brought several kinds of traditions from Mainland China, and these Han People traditions gradually changed on Formosa Island and became the new Taiwanese tradition.\n\nIn comparison, modern Taiwanese culture is based in Japan. During the Japanese colonial period, Taiwan was under relatively moderate rule, and the country naturally embraced various modern Japanese cultures while undergoing Japanese colonization. In 1945, Japan withdrew from Formosa, but the Taiwanese have continued to naturally consume Japanese culture as a popular culture since then.\n\nAnd then it's the 21st century. We need Taiwan's pop culture that is differentiated from mainland China. Japan is the most reasonable alternative to growing Taiwan's Soft Power. Their pop culture is already familiar to us and can be accepted without resistance. But maybe a fast-growing Korea can be an alternative."

This song depicts Taiwan's geographical beauty and its history of being free from external aggression.\n\nAnother song written in the 1970s, The Beautiful Island, is similar to Taiwan The Formosa in that it supports the separatism of the island.

 POLITICS_LEE_TENG_HUI_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 15th January 1923, in Sanshi Village, Taihoku Prefecture, Japanese Taiwan\n§YPolitical Career:§! Lee Teng-hui, known by his birth name as Masao Iwasato, was born and raised in Japanese Taiwan, where he learned about bushido and Japanese culture. In 1945, during the Bombing of Tokyo, he commanded anti-aircraft guns as a second lieutenant and engaged with the American military his efforts, Japan was defeated in World War II. After Japan's defeat, he returned to Taiwan, where he saw the Kuomintang regime's military repression on the 'February 28 incident', in which they massacred Benshengren, Taiwanese natives. He joined the Communist Party out of hatred for the KMT, but left it two years later because communism was too 'unrealistic' to save Taiwan.\n\nHe decided to free the citizens of Taiwan from the 'white horrors' of the KMT, and unlike other Taiwanese pro-democracy activists, he directly joined the KMT, which he hated, to try to reform from within. Having gained power within the KMT, he became Taiwan's leader in 1988, and by the early 1990s he had been working with the country's DPP leaders to implement gradual democratic reforms in the country's military dictatorship. He was given the nickname of 'Mr. Democracy' and became a symbol of democracy in Taiwan."
 
 POLITICS_LIEN_CHAN_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 27th August 1936, in Xi'an, Shaanxi, Republic of China\n§YPolitical Career:§! \"China and Japan will battle inevitably. If the child born is a boy, name him Lien Chan, signifying that the strength coming from within oneself will never diminish and can overcome the enemies and be victorious. It also has the meaning of reviving the former nation, and reorganizing the light and hope of our homeland.\"\n\nJust like his name, which his grandfather, Lien Heng, gave himself, Lien Chan lived life to regain the light and hope of his country. He designed welfare programs for Taiwanese residents and worked to achieve Taiwan's diplomatic achievements despite international isolation\n\nAnd, reunification with mainland China is the last hope he can leave for his citizens. Can Taiwan survive alone in the 21st century? Already isolated internationally, Taiwan will enjoy greater prosperity not as a country but as a self-governing province aided by its benevolent father, PR China.\n\nHe does not think that the attempt to incorporate Taiwan into mainland China is a treasonous act against its citizens. It is a disaster for the 'Republic of China', but for its citizens, it gives them the right to become citizens of a powerful nation. That is why this is a grace and a reward for his citizens."
 
 POLITICS_CHEN_SHUI_BIAN_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 12th October 1950, in Guantian District, Tainan County, Republic of China\n§YPolitical Career:§! Are Taiwanese Chinese? Kuomintang would say, 'Yes!' But Chen \"A-bian\" Shui-bian knows the teeth of a poisonous snake hidden in the sweet lie. Since the defeat of the Japanese Empire in 1945, the KMT has been conducting decades of military dictatorship on the island of Taiwan. For the Chinese, Taiwan was another colony, and they never considered Taiwan an equal.\n\nA former lawyer, he entered politics in the 1980s through the 'Tangwai' movement, a pro-democracy movement in Taiwan. Chen Shui-bian used his lawyer's career to support pro-democracy activists who were unfairly suppressed and gained social influence in the process.\n\nWith the expectations of countless Taiwanese citizens, he was elected to the Taiwanese presidency. He will not let the former disgraceful 20th century return. Taiwan has never been a territory of the Republic of China. Taiwan will be freed as a 'Taiwan Republic' separate from China."
 
 POLITICS_CHEN_SHUI_BIAN_2004_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 12th October 1950, in Guantian District, Tainan County, Republic of China\n§YPolitical Career:§! Pan-nationalist madness is at their peak. Just before the 2004 presidential election, traitors tried to destroy Taiwan's dream of independence with an assassination attempt against Chen Shui-bian. But he survived the traitors' attempts and is ready to fight for Taiwan's liberation with more enthusiasm than ever before.\n\nA former lawyer, he entered politics in the 1980s through the 'Tangwai' movement, a pro-democracy movement in Taiwan. Chen Shui-bian used his lawyer's career to support pro-democracy activists who were unfairly suppressed and gained social influence in the process.\n\nWith the expectations of countless Taiwanese citizens, he was elected to the Taiwanese presidency. He will not let the former disgraceful 20th century return. Taiwan has never been a territory of the Republic of China. Taiwan will be freed as a 'Taiwan Republic' separate from China.\n\nAnd through the 2004 presidential election, he took one step closer to that dream. Taiwan will be liberated. At all costs."
 
 POLITICS_WU_SHU_CHEN_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 11th July 1953, in Madou, Tainan County, Taiwan Province, Republic of China\n§YPolitical Career:§! The first lady of Chen Shui-bian was by Chen's side throughout his pro-democracy movement. She helped Chen Shui-bian during his efforts to liberate Taiwan and worked with him on his dream of Taiwanese independence. Due to her political activities, she suffered an attempted assassination in 1985 with an \"unknown background\". The attempted truck assassination left her paraplegia, unable to get out of a wheelchair for life.\n\nAnd Chen Shui-bian's assassination in 2004 was her second wound. The KMT took away half of her, once again her remaining half. All that remains is the unfulfilled dream of a dead husband; Taiwan's perfect freedom. She will not be frustrated forever. Taiwan must be liberated. The self-proclaimed 'Republic of China' must be extinguished forever. And, the hateful Kuomintang must also burn from hell. And in the burning hell, the supporters of the Kuomintang will belatedly remember that they assassinated someone they should never have killed. But, there will be no way for them to atone for their sins.\n\n§RNever.§!"
 
 POLITICS_ANNETTE_LU_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 7th June 1944, in Tōen Town, Shinchiku Prefecture, Japanese Taiwan\n§YPolitical Career:§! Annette Lu, a participant in Taiwan's \"Tangwai\" movement, a democracy movement in the 20th century, and a well-known feminist activist in Taiwan, was not mentioned as a possible presidential candidate despite her long political career. Her influence within the DPP was limited, and her highest political position was likely to be vice president. If the assassination of Chen Shui-bian had not occurred.\n\nSince the assassination of her political colleague and longtime partner Chen Shui-bian, She had the heavy burden of inheriting the dream of \"Taiwan liberation\", which Chen Shui-bian could not achieve. But she won't stop. To inherit the dream of a dead old colleague and make it the dream of all Taiwanese citizens."
 
 POLITICS_MA_YING_JEOU_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 13th July 1950, in Yau Ma Tei, British Hong Kong\n§YPolitical Career:§! Taiwan's foolish 'Taiwan nationalism' gambling, which has been going on since 2000, is finally over. Chen Shui-bian and his supporters were leading Taiwan down a dangerous path. Why didn't they trust the Chinese leader? Mainland China can protect Taiwan with its broad benevolence.\n\nMa Ying-jeou, who served on the Mainland Affairs Council, which manages diplomatic relations between mainland China and Taiwan in the late 20th century, believes in China's power. He said in public that he would support Taiwan's \"maintenance of the status quo\", but in a 2006 interview in Britain, he said his role was to lead the reunification with mainland China.\n\nIt is not known if what he wants is the status quo or reunite with mainland China. Perhaps his choice will be decided by international circumstances. But one thing is clear; His term will be a dark time for Taiwanese nationalists."
 
 POLITICS_TSAI_ING_WEN_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 31st August 1956, in Zhongshan, Taipei, Republic of China\n§YPolitical Career:§! What kind of politician is Tsai \"Kirishima Xiao-ing\" Ing-wen? Her opponents accuse her of being overly moderate and ambiguous in her foreign policy. Compared to other DPP politicians, she seems to be more interested in ecology and LGBTQ rights than in Taiwanese nationalism. Her affection and love for Japanese pop culture have earned her the cynicism of Chinese pan-nationalists. Why does she upload internet her New Year's greetings in Japanese every year? To Chinese pan-nationalists, this is \"disgraceful\".\n\nEven some DPP politicians do not support her policies. Some DPP politicians, such as Shih Ming-teh, have even called for her to come out as a lesbian, citing her high sensitivity to LGBTQ rights issues and the fact that she has not had a romantic relationship with any men.\n\nBut for her supporters, Tsai Ing-wen is a true leader who can change Taiwan. She wants to focus on policies for minority groups that have so far been relatively marginalized because of Taiwanese nationalism policy. She promotes policies to expand childcare rights for young children, and to expand LGBTQ and women's rights. New policies are being implemented for Yuanzhumin(Taiwanese aborigine) in Taiwan, and new employment promotion services are being created for young people. Even if she is hated by both DPP hardliners and KMT politicians, she is ready to speak out loudest for all the marginalized in Taiwan."

We have a presidential election in the year of the dragon, and the Hungry Red Dragon is getting ready to blow flames at us. It's time for a leader who can protect Taiwan. Who could be the knight to defeat the Red Dragon?"

 CHI_the_reform_of_the_single_member_constituencies_desc: "To stabilize Taiwan's politics, a two-party system is more appropriate than a multi-party system. If elections were held under the election law, especially in favor of the multi-party system, Pan Green, divided into several parties, would not be able to win against the united Kuomintang. That's why Taiwan's parliamentary election laws should be 'single-member district'."

The moderates, who call themselves 'Huádú', argue that the status quo itself is effectively the same as Taiwan's independence. But Chen Shui-bian doesn't agree with this.
