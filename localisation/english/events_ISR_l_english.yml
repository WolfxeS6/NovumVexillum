 israel.1.t:0 "The Retreat from Lebanon"
 israel.1.d:0 "The Israeli retreat from Southern Lebanon, occupied since the Lebanese Civil War of 1982, had been long planned and, according to the United Nations, overdue. While internal support is split, knowing the soldiers' home will not hurt the Israeli people."
 israel.1.o1:0 "The boys are home."
 israel.1.o2:0 "We need to guarantee our security !"
 israel.2.t:0 "Negotiations over Golan"
 israel.2.d:0 "The Golan Heights have been occupied by Israeli forces since the Six Days War of 1967. The international community has put repeated pressure on us to at least negotiate over their return to Syria. While acceptance seems unlikely, at least sending a signal might be worthwhile. We should however not forget that Golan is an easily defendable position and heavily fortified. If we decide not to trust the Syrians, keeping the Golan Heights is definitely the way to go."
 israel.2.o1:0 "Offer Syria to negotiate."
 israel.2.o2:0 "Negotiate with Assad? Never!"
 israel.3.t:0 "Israel offers to negotiate over Golan"
 israel.3.d:0 "The Israeli government has informed us that they are interested in sorting out the future of the Golan Heights diplomatically."
 israel.3.o1:0 "Let's see where this leads."
 israel.3.o2:0 "At a table with the zionists? Never!"
 israel.4.t:0 "Syria Is Willing to Negotiate"
 israel.4.d:0 "Syria has accepted our offer and is now awaiting an offer."
 israel.4.o1:0 "Offer them a military alliance in exchange for Golan."
 israel.4.o2:0 "A military cooperation should be sufficient."
 israel.5.t:0 "Israel offers alliance for Golan"
 israel.5.d:0 "'If Syria is willing to accept a permanent military alliance with Israel, as well as to recognize it as the rightful owner of its internationally recognized territory, we will retreat from Golan.' \nThe words of the Israeli Prime Minister were followed by a long pause. An alliance is an incredibly unpopular idea in Syria, but the opportunity to recover Golan peacefully and to gain a powerful ally like Israel might be too great to pass up."
 israel.5.o1:0 "A risky move, but indeed what might be necessary."
 israel.5.o2:0 "What?! Death is a preferable alternative to that!"
 israel.6.t:0 "Israel Offers Military Cooperation"
 israel.6.d:0 "The voices in Israel demanding an unobtainable offer were quickly silenced and followed by a quite reasonable offer: Should the Syrian and Israeli forces agree to conduct common manuevres and to establish a constant communications channel, Israel is to retreat from Golan."
 israel.6.o1:0 "Sounds like a bargain!"
 israel.6.o2:0 "How about no?"
 israel.7.t:0"Israel Stays in Southern Lebanon"
 israel.7.d:0"Despite the promises of Ehud Barak to withdraw all Israeli soldiers from Lebanon within a year of its first mandate as prime minister, the occupation forces seem to keep their positions in the "South Lebanon Security Belt". The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) have asked the Israeli authorities about their departure but it's likely they won't get any meaningful commitments...  "
 israel.7.o1:0"We'll leave when Lebanon gets stable enough."
 israel.7.o2:0"Outrageous !"
