### Infantry Equipment ###
 RCO_infantry_equipment_0:0 "AKM"
 RCO_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "AKM"
 RCO_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The AKM is most mass produced AK-47 variant. Introduced in 1959, the AKM offers various small but collectively noticeable improvements, such as new safety features and a lighter weight when loaded. It remained the main rifle of the Warsaw Pact until the 1970s."
 RCO_infantry_equipment_1:0 "AK-74"
 RCO_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "AK-74"
 RCO_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The AK-74 served as the replacement of the by-then obsolete AKM in 1979, first being used in the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan. It had a different cartridge than previous models, and boasted improved range, firing accuracy, and durability. It remains the most commonly used rifle by former Communist Nations, and the few remaining ones."

 RCO_infantry_equipment_2_103_short:0 "AK-103"
 RCO_infantry_equipment_2_103_desc:0 "The AK-103 is an AK-100 derivative that is chambered in 7.62x39mm cartridge like the AKM. It can be fitted with optical sights and grenade launchers like the GP-34. It has reduced weight compared to the AKM by swapping out metal/wood where possible with plastic."
 RCO_infantry_equipment_2:0 "AK-74M"
 RCO_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "AK-74M"
 RCO_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The AK-74M, as the name would imply, is a modernised version of the AK-74. It swaps out large amounts of wood/metal with plastic where possible to save on weight. Another notable feature is that its stock is glass-filled polyamide and side-folds to reduce the stowage space of the rifle. Another advantage of the modernisation is its side-rail bracket for mounting optics."
 RCO_infantry_equipment_3:0 "AK-12"
 RCO_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "AK-12"
 RCO_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The AK-12 is a Russian assault rifle chambered in 5.45×39mm. It was designed and manufactured by Kalashnikov Concern. The final production model of the AK-12 is said to be more reliable, more accurate and better suited to the latest Russian military requirements. It is based on the AK-400."

 RCO_mechanized_equipment_1_desc:0 "The BMP-1 is famed as the first true infantry fighting vehicle. It's concept was to combine an APC and a light tank to allow infantry to operate in relative safety. Unlike other infantry transports the BMP-1 had a smoothbore gun in addition to ATGMs to ward off armour."

 RCO_mechanized_equipment_2_short:0 "BMP-2"
 RCO_mechanized_equipment_2_desc:0 "From experience in the Yom Kippur war and the RCOiet-Afgan war, an improved version of the BMP-1 was created. The BMP-2 has an autocannon and a far better ATGM (9M113 Konkurs) which allows it to better support infantry. It was found the BMP-1s armour was ineffective on its sides and read to .50 caliber so the BMP-2 has far greater armour."
 RCO_mechanized_equipment_3:0 "BMP-3"
 RCO_mechanized_equipment_3_short:0 "BMP-3"
 RCO_mechanized_equipment_3_desc:0 "A far heavier infantry fighting vehicle than the BMP-2 and the most armed any IFV. It carriers a 2A70 100mm rifled gun that can also fire 9M117 Bastion ATGMs with an autoloader."
