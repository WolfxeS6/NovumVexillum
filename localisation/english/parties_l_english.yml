According to Lee's theory, democracy is optimized for their ideas and culture because it is the concept of 'Westerners', and East Asians are considered to have no ability to understand or use democracy. Asian values claim that instead of having the same horizontal relationship as the West, East Asians are more used to being loyal to the state and society based on Confucian culture, and giving up individual freedom.\n\nIn real politics, Managed democracy focuses on Confucian traditions, allowing authoritarian governments to restrict people's freedom and political activities for those who cannot make full use of the \"Democratic System\". but instead, unlike authoritarian governments on other continents, governments also promise the country's continuous economic and industrial development. Unlike other authoritarian dictatorships, which tend to remain undeveloped, Singapore has been able to developed country into an advanced country by emphasizing the \"importance of work based on Confucianism.\" However, despite its remarkable economic success, the PAP's ideology of \"Not being able to apply democracy to Asians\" has been strongly criticized by democrats in many East Asian countries."

However, a coup in 1997 under the Hun Sen government caused FUNCINPEC to lose political influence in Cambodia. FUNCINPEC wants to further extend the power of the monarch, while at the same time support right-wing conservatism.\n\nDuring the Cold War, most members of Cambodia's communist party Khmer Rouge continued guerrilla activities even after the collapse of the Cambodian communist government. However, since the 1990s, Khmer Rouge's military guerrilla activities have significantly declined, In 1997, Khmer Rouge joined Cambodia's royalist forces in exchange for abandoning its support for communist leader Pol Pot. Cambodian communists who did not join the royalists were completely wiped out when they formally surrendered to the government in 1999.§!"

The nobility of the Confucius family lasted until 1935, and in 1935 the Republic of China renamed his nobility the 'Ceremonial Official to Confucius', an honorary position appropriate for a democratic state.\n\nAfter the Communist Party of China took control of China, Ceremonial Official to Confucius fled to the Taiwan, where his descendants inherited the honorary position until the 21st century.§!"

CPRF divided the left forces of Russia into 2 parties, which also influenced the Yeltsin victory in 1993 Moscow events (known in Russia as "Black October").\n\nBy 1995 RCWP had lost much of its popular support and CPRF started to become the leading Russian left party. Despite American help to the Yeltsin regime CPRF won the 1996 elections, but pro-Yeltsin electoral frauds brought victory to the previous president. As a parliamentary moderate party, CPRF didn't do anything to change the election results.\n\nPartys program aims to establish a social state in Russia without much interruption into business and oligarchal spheres.\n\n§!"

In the 1990s this party was quite influential and could organize rallies with hundreds of thousands of participants. However, with time party lost much of people`s support.\n\nDuring the last party congress in 2000 it was decided that workers should have a majority in all party departments and the majority of decisive votes in all party congresses. This decision can cause a split inside the party as there are party members who don't want to share their power with workers.\n\n§!"
