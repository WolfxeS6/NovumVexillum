 mad_dog_desc:0 "United States Marine Corps General James Norman Mattis has earned himself the title 'Mad Dog' both for his exceptional services to both the Marine Corps and the US Military in general as well as his noted behavior of being a loudmouth and a rhetorical tough guy when away from the front - stirring up a few controversies along the way. His supporters both in the military and among the civilian population love him to death, his critics fear him as a possibly irrational and unreliable commander. But let's be real, no one can stop the Mad Dog."
