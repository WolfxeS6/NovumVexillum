They discovered the AK platform required less maintenance and so modernised it based on the Finnish RK-62 but to be chambered in both 5.56x45mm NATO and 7.62x51mm NATO. The most distinct difference between it and an AK-47 is the sight placement with the rear sight being much further back giving greater accuracy when firing."
