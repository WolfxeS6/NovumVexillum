 upgraded_infantry_weapons2:0 "Airburst Weapons"
 upgraded_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "Airburst rounds are anti-personnel explosive ammunition that detonates in midair. Airburst small arms will make it easier for our infantry to hit enemy soldiers behind cover, or typically out of reach from regular weaponry."
 upgraded_infantry_weapons3:0 "Integrated Battlefield"
 upgraded_infantry_weapons3_desc:0 "By linking the digital and physical world, our soldiers will have unprecedented situational awareness and combat cohesion. Using new HUD systems, ubiquitous designation equipment, and drone technology, the battlefield will hold no obstacle which cannot be overcome."
 infantry_rifle_upgrade:0 "Rail Integration System"
 infantry_rifle_upgrade_desc:0 "Rail integration system is a generic term for a standardised rail system for attaching accessories to small firearms such as pistols, rifles and light machine guns."
 infantry_rifle_upgrade2:0 "Improved Optics"
 infantry_rifle_upgrade2_desc:0 "A red dot sight is a common classification for a type of non-magnifying reflector sight for firearms, and other devices that require aiming, that gives the user an aimpoint in the form of an illuminated red dot. A standard design uses a red light-emitting diode at the focus of collimating optics which generates a dot-style illuminated reticle that stays in alignment with the weapon the sight is attached to regardless of eye position."
 infantry_rifle_upgrade3:0 "Advanced Optics"
 infantry_rifle_upgrade3_desc:0 "A reflector sight or reflex sight is an optical device that allows the user to look through a partially reflecting glass element and see an illuminated projection of an aiming point or some other image superimposed on the field of view. These sights work on the simple optical principle that anything at the focus of a lens or curved mirror will appear to be sitting in front of the viewer at infinity."
 infantry_rifle_upgrade4:0 "Thermal Optics"
 infantry_rifle_upgrade4_desc:0 "A thermographic weapon sight, thermal imagery scope or thermal weapon sight is a sighting device combining a compact thermographic camera and an aiming reticle. They can be mounted on a variety of small arms as well as some heavier weapons."

 support_weapons3_desc:0 "Platoon level support weapons being able to eliminate more modern armour defensively at short range improves the combat effectiveness of our units in a more mechanised era."
 support_weapons4:0 "Improved Anti-Tank Weapons"
 support_weapons4_desc:0 "Fire-and-forget systems at the squad level helps infantry quickly and accurately engage armoured threats and then retreat into cover. Having a more complex warhead should help defeat ERA."
 support_weapons5:0 "Infantry Automatic Rifle"
 support_weapons5_desc:0 "An infantryman being able to accurately suppress enemy combatants without the need for a specialised automatic-rifleman can give even greater flexibility to fireteams. Lighter infantry weapons than traditional automatic-rifles allows the weapons to be far more widespread without impacting mobility"

 support_weapons6_desc:0 "Being able to engage airborne targets at a company level gives greater protection against SEAD operations and can prevent helicopters or drones from reaping havoc on our lines"
 support_weapons7:0 "Lightweight Support Weapons"
 support_weapons7_desc:0 "A focus on lighter weapons should give our troops a greater ability to quickly move up required support weapons to efficiently engage enemy assets."
 support_weapons8:0 "Future Support Weapons"
 support_weapons8_desc:0 "Integration of sensors and automatic weapons allows even a small platoon to deal with much larger formations."
 night_vision:0 "GEN 2 Night Vision"
 night_vision_desc:0 "First-generation passive devices varied from earlier night vision by not requiring an infrared light source and instead relying on ambient light. The devices are quite bulky and only suitable for large scopes. Second-generation devices are considerably brighter than first-generation and also cut down considerably on size."
 night_vision2:0 "GEN 3+ Night Vision"
 night_vision2_desc:0 "Third-generation and Generation 3+ (sometimes referred to as fourth-generation) night vision provides a much clearer picture compared to previous generations. Some devices can adapt to changing light conditions automatically."
 night_vision3:0 "Fusion Night Vision"

 night_vision4:0 "Out of Band Night Vision"
 night_vision4_desc:0 "This form of night vision refers to ones that operate outside of 500-900 nm NIR. This leads to more light being visible to the scope, it is also useful for laser designators that use 1064nm light which is barely visible on third-generation night vision."
 night_vision5:0 "One Way Luminescence Tracer"
 night_vision5_desc:0 "Placeholder"
 night_vision6:0 "Wide Field of View Night Vision"
 night_vision6_desc:0 "Night vision devices have a limited field of view, typically only 40 degrees compared to normal 190 degrees of binocular vision without night vision. The use of panoramic night vision goggles (PNVG) increases the field of view by increasing the number of sensors making it ideal for special forces who operate in close quarters where a larger field of view is essential."
 body_armor:0 "Ballistic Nylon Body Armour"
 body_armor_desc:0 "Sometimes called a flak vest, using around 12 layers of ballistic nylon to form a vest for infantry to use. Not designed to stop bullets it is used to deal with grenade fragments and smaller pellets used in shotguns."
 body_armor2:0 "Kevlar Body Armour"
 body_armor2_desc:0 "Kevlar was found to be a long stronger than even ballistic grade nylon. In a similar fashion as Ballistic Nylon it uses a layered approach with 19 layers or so of Kevlar."
 body_armor3:0 "Ceramic Body Armour"
 body_armor3_desc:0 "Ceramic plates using Boron carbide added into kevlar vests allows for a much greater level of protection against even assault rifles. Their downside is they are only designed to take a single hit however potentially could provide some level of protection even after its initial use."
 body_armor4:0 "Modern Body Armour"
 body_armor4_desc:0 ""
 body_armor5:0 "Polyethylene Body Armour"
 body_armor5_desc:0 "Ultra-high-molecular-weight-polyethylene is a thermoplatic polyethylene. This uses extremely long chains to transfer load more effectively across the body reducing the bruising from impacts as well as being able to withstand greater velocities of rounds."
 body_armor6:0 "Composite Metal Foam Body Armour"
 body_armor6_desc:0 "Using other materials such as Alumina and Silicon carbide can help protect the user from tungsten carbide penetrators. A foam helps reduce the biggest threat to body armours, that being the need to replace plates upon use. With a foam it can self-heal to an extent allowing for the continued use of a single plate throughout an operation passed its first use."
 body_armor7:0 "Liquid Body Armour"
 body_armor7_desc:0 "Single plate armour has a disadvantage of only spreading the load of a shot across the chest of the user. Using liquid not only will the armour be multi use but can also spread the force across the entire body and thus reducing the bruising to the chest. This is critical as this will reduce the potential damage to organs during potentially multiple shots."
 camouflage:0 "Camouflage Fatigues"
 camouflage_desc:0 "Camouflage helps increase the stealth of our infantry and increase the time for enemy combatants to target them."
 camouflage2:0 "MultiCam"
 camouflage2_desc:0 "A single camouflage pattern that works in most environments allows our units not to be caught out when changing theatre or terrain."
 camouflage3:0 "Modern Fatigues"
 camouflage3_desc:0 "Ensuring our fatigues are long lasting, comfortable and importantly fire retardant will have a great improvement to the effectiveness of our soldiers."
 camouflage4:0 "Improved Camouflage Patterns"
 camouflage4_desc:0 "Improving our camouflage to vests, helmets and fatigues will reduce enemy scouting capabilities as well as helping to differentiate ourselves from our fellow multicam adversaries."
 camouflage5:0 "Future Camouflage Patterns"
 camouflage5_desc:0 "Complex patterns to disorient the enemy gives our troops the extra seconds needed to engage and eliminate the threat. The addition of infrared dampening will reduce the risk of thermal sensors."
 camouflage6:0 "Electro-Optical Camouflage"
 camouflage6_desc:0 "Constantly adjusting camouflage to the environment in a sensor dense environment would be a challenge but if successful could grant our troops a near 'invisibility cloak'."

 near_future_encryption_desc:0 "A quantum cryptographic protocol is device-independent if its security does not rely on trusting that the quantum devices used are truthful. Thus, the security analysis of such a protocol needs to consider scenarios of imperfect or even malicious devices. Several important problems have been shown to admit unconditional secure and device-independent protocols."
 future_encryption:1 "Encryption - Post-Quantum Cryptography"
 future_encryption_desc:0 "Post-quantum cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms (usually public-key algorithms) that are thought to be secure against an attack by a quantum computer. The problem with currently popular algorithms is that their security relies on one of three hard mathematical problems: the integer factorization problem, the discrete logarithm problem or the elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem. All of these problems can be easily solved on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Shor's algorithm."
 basic_decryption:1 "Decryption - Public-Key Cryptography"
 basic_decryption_desc:0 "A potential security vulnerability in using asymmetric keys is the possibility of a "man-in-the-middle" attack, in which the communication of public keys is intercepted by a third party and then modified to provide different public keys instead. Encrypted messages and responses must also be intercepted, decrypted, and re-encrypted by the attacker using the correct public keys for different communication segments, in all instances, to avoid suspicion."
 improved_decryption:1 "Decryption - Hash Attacks"
 improved_decryption_desc:0 "There is a long list of cryptographic hash functions, but many are vulnerable and should not be used. Many cryptographic hashes are based on the Merkle–Damgård construction. All cryptographic hashes that directly use the full output of a Merkle–Damgård construction are vulnerable to length extension attacks. This makes the MD5, SHA-1, RIPEMD-160, Whirlpool and the SHA-256 / SHA-512 hash algorithms all vulnerable against this specific attack."
 advanced_decryption:1 "Decryption - AES Side-Channel Attacks"
 advanced_decryption_desc:0 "Side-channel attacks do not attack the cipher as a black box, and thus are not related to cipher security as defined in the classical context but are important in practice. They attack implementations of the cipher on hardware or software systems that inadvertently leak data. Due to the accepted reality that AES is unbreakable, this is the primary mode of attack against it."
 near_future_decryption:1 "Decryption - Hypothetical Quantum Security Attacks"
 near_future_decryption_desc:0 "A rise in quantum encryption calls for advances in respective decryption. By modifying age-old methods, and developing uniquely quantum attacks, the balance of security will remain uncertain."
 future_decryption:1 "Decryption - Post-Quantum Security Research"
 future_decryption_desc:0 "In cryptography research, it is desirable to prove the equivalence of a cryptographic algorithm and a known hard mathematical problem. These proofs are often called "security reductions” and are used to demonstrate the difficulty of cracking the encryption algorithm. In other words, the security of a given cryptographic algorithm is reduced to the security of a known hard problem. Researchers are actively looking for security reductions in the prospects for post-quantum cryptography."

 antitank1:0 "Tandem-Charge Warheads"
 antitank1_desc:0 "Tandem charges are effective against reactive armour, which is designed to protect an armoured vehicle against anti-tank munitions. The first stage of the weapon is typically a weak charge that either pierces the reactive armour of the target without detonating it, leaving a channel through the reactive armour so that the second warhead may pass unimpeded, or simply detonating the armour plate causing the timing of the counter-explosion to fail."
