 POLITICS_rinchinnyamyn_amarjargal_DESC:0 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 2nd February 1961, in Ulaanbaatar City, Mongolian People's Republic\n§YPolitical Career:§! Rinchinnyamyn Amarjargal, who was appointed prime minister on July 30, 1999, is forced to unite right-wing forces as a leader to prepare for elections in Mongolia's parliament just over a year away. But is it an easy thing to do? Amarjargal was originally a figure who didn't have to be prime minister. After the collapse of the communist proletarian dictatorship that dominated Mongolia for decades, the legendary Mongolian pro-democracy activist Sanjaasürengiin Zorig was the most reasonable alternative to rallying Mongolia's anti-communist democratic factions in the 1990s. During the unprecedented Mongolian economic crisis, politicians agreed to appoint Zorig as Mongolia's prime minister on 5th October 1998. But tragedy has come. On 2nd October 1998, when an unidentified assassin assassinated Zorig, Mongolian right-wing forces lost their center at once. Mongolia had to find a new leader, as Zorig died three days before his term as prime minister began. The new alternative was the Mayor of Ulaanbaatar Janlavyn Narantsatsralt. However, Narantsatsralt resigned after a short term due to a confrontation with the opposition Mongolian People's Party, and the economist Amarjargal became the new prime minister.\n\nWith just a few months to go before the general election, the task given to Amarjargal is too heavy. Because of the economic crisis, the public's approval rating for the right-wing ruling party is not that great. The socialist party MPRP is rallying public support, blaming the ruling party for failing to solve economic problems. but Amarjargal doesn't seem to have the right charisma to rally public support in this election..."

After Zorig's assassination, she won a by-election in 1998 to become a member of the National Assembly, and founded the 'Zorig Foundation' for the Mongolian human rights movement.\n\nShe wants to follow Zorig's footsteps and reform Mongolia into a completely new liberal state. Of course, for this reform, the old socialists will have to disappear.."

The MPRP will be able to win more than 75 percent of seats alone, according to polls. The Big Tent ruling party is already showing signs of being split into several parties due to internal conflicts.

The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) was a rulling party in Mongolia from the 1920s until 1990. During the Cold War, the MPRP forcibly ruled Mongolia with the support of the Soviet Union, which destroyed many of Mongolia's Buddhist culture. However, after the Mongolian Democratic Revolution in 1990, MPRP's influence in Mongolian politics decreased. MPRP abandoned Marxism and chose democratic socialism as its official ideology.\n\nThe opposition to the MPRP is the Democratic Union Coalition. The DUC is technically a 'political coalition' not a political party. It is a coalition of conservatives from Mongolian National Democratic Party and the social democrats from Mongolian Social Democratic Party. The DUC succeeded in becoming Mongolia's ruling party after the Mongolian Revolution, but the Big Tent coalition is showing signs of division.\n\nLastly, rumors are circulating that Oyunn, the sister of Zorig, a legendary Mongolian pro-democracy activist, is preparing for a new party. She is planning a party named the Civil Will Party and wants to unite Mongolia's liberal forces in the 2000 election."

 mongolia.introgame.3.desc:0 "Mongolia has the worst geographical conditions. It is difficult to export goods because there is no sea, and the entire border is surrounded by two countries, Russia and China. Unless two countries, Russia and China, open their borders, Mongolia cannot import any goods or export any goods. That's why Mongolia has a lot of underground resources, but China and Russia can buy them from Mongolia for less than its original value.\n\nIt is important for Mongolia to maintain a balance between the two countries, Russia and China. However, one of them will eventually become Mongolia's more important economic partner. China is expected to become a more important partner if the MPRP comes to power, but some politicians think that Russia can be an alternative to China."

Although there is no evidence, many Zorig's supporters believed that socialists were behind his assassination. because they were the only political force that could benefit from his assassination. Some hardliners inside the DUC have suggested that they declare a major reinvestigation of the Zorig case to wreak havoc on the MPRP in the election, although they are not capable of obtaining hard evidence.\n\nThe 2000 election is expected to focus on \"economic\" issues. But if the reinvestigation of Zorig's assassination and investigation of MPRP members were launched, the mood of the election would be completely different. "

Today, some of [FROM.GetAdjective] diplomats have been taking secret approaches to government politicians. They say they have evidence of MPRP involvement in Zorig's assassination. Although this evidence was provided by foreigners, it is possible that it was fabricated. But if we re-investigate the Zorig assassination at their suggestion, it could hurt MPRP greatly.\n\nThe 2000 election is expected to focus on \"economic\" issues.

Today, [MON.GetLeader] and [MON.GetLeader.GetHerHim] entourage had a formal meeting with [CHI.GetLeader] in Taipei. The most important political topic was the diplomatic cooperation of the two countries. By old law, the whole of Mongolia was set up as a de jure territory in Taiwan. [CHI.GetLeader] said [CHI.GetLeader.GetSheHe] would delete this clause as soon as possible, saying, 'It is nonsense that Mongolia is part of Taiwan.'\n\nSince mainland China separates Mongolia and Taiwan, a trade agreement between the two countries is expected to be difficult. However, Mongolia and Taiwan agreed to \"close military cooperation\" to respect each other's sovereignty and keep mainland China in check together.

DUC has already completely lost popularity with Mongolian people due to the political incompetence of the 1990s. Because citizens already despise DUC, any campaign in this election will not make it possible for they to succeed in regaining power.\n\nBut at least there may be a way to stop the establishment of a socialist government of the MPRP. The way is to re-investigate the assassination of Zorig, Mongolia's national hero. While many people suspect that the MPRP was behind the assassination of Zorig, there is no direct evidence that the MPRP was involved in this. Because there is no evidence, this may not be judged as the right political action, but if it can deepen suspicions about MPRP in the people... the outcome of the election could be different."
