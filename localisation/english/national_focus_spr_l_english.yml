It is the fifth largest shipbuilder in Europe, and the ninth largest in the world with shipyards all over Spain. Astilleros Españoles SA had been created in 1967 by merging the Basque shipyards of Euskalduna, La Naval de Sestao and Astilleros de Cádiz. In July 2000 it merged with the public naval shipyards, Empresa Nacional Bazán, to form IZAR. In March 2005 Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (SEPI) fusioned the naval wing of IZAR into Navantia. Navantia, the Spanish shipbuilder, 100% owned by SEPI, the Spanish Government Industrial Holding, is engaged in the design, construction and integration of warships, as well as ship repairs & modernizations. It is also engaged in the design and manufacture of Integrated Platform Management Systems, Fire Control Systems, Command and Control systems, Propulsion Plants and through life support for all its products. Even though its main line of activity is in the naval field, Navantia designs and manufactures systems for the Army and the Air Force. Navantia has a shiprepair line of activity that goes from regular repairs to refurbishment programmes, including conversions. The company has the facilities and know-how for complex repairs comprising LNG’S and Cruisers. Navantia has Fleet Maintenance Agreements with ship-owners. It also has an important presence in the development of new technologies in the off-shore Oil and Gas and wind energy markets. Navantia has experience in building technologically advanced ships like frigates, amphibious ships, patrol vessels, and submarines. In the last years, it has supplied ships for different navies, like Norway, Australia, Chile, Spain, India, Thailand, Venezuela. It has also been selected in Turkey as the designer for the LPD program. Navantia is a reference in surface warships, having been able to integrate the AEGIS LM system in a much smaller platform. It has designed and built the F-100 Alvaro de Bazán class frigates (5 units) for the Spanish Navy and the F-310 Fridtjof Nansen class (5 units) in service at the Royal Norwegian Navy. The Australian Warfare Destroyer, currently under construction, is another Navantia design also based on the Navantia F-100 frigate. At present the challenge is the F-110, the future Spanish Frigate that will have to perform new capacities and missions in a changing and challenging international scenario. The F-310 class frigates are one of the programmes the company has executed. They have already participated in various international missions: F310 in Sea Squad, USA (2007), F310 in Somalia (2009), F311 exercised with the US Navy in 2008, F313 and F310 exercised with NATO in 2010. In September 2007, Navantia won the contract, as the main partner, for two amphibious ships for the Royal Australian Navy very similar to the LHD “Juan Carlos I” that Navantia has built for the Spanish Navy. The Spanish offer for the design and construction of these ships, based on the Spanish LHD, was selected because it completely met the requirements of the Royal Australian Navy. The contract included the design and construction of the ships, as well as some equipment, e.g. engines and electronic platform control systems, provided by Navantia."

But if the industry were able to increase the average size of its companies and Spain as a country to improve factors such as the quality of education or the administrative burden, this contribution to economic growth would be much greater. In terms of R & D, the Spanish industry invests 0.84% ​​of the value of its production, while the European average exceeds 1.5%, or almost double. If we calculate that every 10% of R & D differential would imply a GDP growth of 0.13%, the improvement of this factor would be equivalent to a GDP increase of 1.17%. The possibilities of increasing the volume of investment in R & D in Spanish industry are, among other measures, attracting one or more of the innovation centres that large multinationals have deployed in other countries - which is not easy to prioritise. , And / or to enhance the innovative activity of small and medium local industry."

But it is a bill made on a fixed photo from the end of 2015. Since then it has been more than a year, and as the public body itself reflects in its report there are still four pending fronts that could raise the cost of the rescue over the 80 billion."

The figure is not far from that offered by the Court of Auditors, which in a recent audit report estimated that 60,718 million euros would be lost, barely a hundred million difference. This means that almost 80% of the money invested in basically cleaning up the Savings Banks, which received public aid valued at more than 76.410 million euros, will be lost."

 spain.88.t:0 "Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA)"
 spain.88.d:0 "The reasons for this worsening of the distributive panorama are several and are due to factors that go beyond the change of economic cycle. In the first place, a basic economic problem linked to an uncompetitive productive structure persists. In the last decades, job creation has been closely linked to very cyclical sectors and the evidence shows that we need relatively high rates of GDP growth to create new jobs. Second, we have a serious structural problem of inequality and vulnerability. Already before the crisis there was a very large percentage of the population with incomes only slightly above the poverty line and very dependent on the dragging effect of the expansion of certain economic activities. Thirdly, we have not been able to consolidate a sufficiently robust protection network, facing the crisis with a very fragmented income guarantee system, with significant gaps in coverage and with large territorial inequalities in the response offered to situations of Insufficient income."

It was the peak of what is probably one of the most bipartisan systems in Europe, if not the largest. But a similar percentage had been maintained since 1982: the PP-PSOE sum never dropped from 65% and was almost always around 75%. In 2011 it still exceeded 73%. This has taken the crisis ahead, according to surveys published by the CIS and by various means in recent months. The two major parties - especially the PP - fall without pause in the estimations of vote: they only add between 45% and 60%; their directions know this and assume it as the "logical" cost of government measures, those of the previous and current. Sources from both parties interpret that the problem is circumstantial, that lasts for the duration of the crisis and that, although they will surely never regain 80% of the votes, the system will remain what it is: only two parties with government options. Faced with this crossroads, the party in the Government asks "time" to implement its policies; and on the other side, State pacts."

It was raised in the 1920s to serve as part of Spain's Army of Africa. The unit, which was established in January 1920 as the Spanish equivalent of the French Foreign Legion, was initially known as the Tercio de Extranjeros ("Tercio of foreigners"), the name under which it began fighting in the Rif War of 1920-6. Although it recruited some foreigners mostly from Spanish-speaking nations, it recruited predominantly from Spaniards. As a result, and since it existed to serve in Spanish Morocco, it was soon renamed Tercio de Marruecos ("Tercio of Morocco"). By the end of the Rif War it had expanded and again changed its name, to the "Spanish Legion", with several "tercios" as subunits. The Legion played a major role in the Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War. In post-Franco Spain, the modern Legion has undertaken tours of duty in the Yugoslav Wars, Afghanistan, Iraq and Operation Libre Hidalgo UNIFIL. The Spanish Legion is now mostly used in NATO peacekeeping missions. It has 5,000 soldiers in a Brigade of two Tercios (regiments) based in Ronda, Málaga and Viator, Almería (Andalusia). Two other independent tercios are deployed in the Spanish African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla as part of their respective garrisons. The legion is directly controlled by the Spanish General Staff. Although the detachment at Málaga was transferred away, each year a company of legionaries from one of the Tercios (regiments) returns to march in the Holy Week procession with the Christ of the Good Death, a life-size effigy of Christ Crucified, adopted by the legion as Patron in the 1920s. It also has its own confraternity with its home chapel located in this historic city, where veterans who served in this unit are counted among its membership. The Legion's detachments also take part in various Holy Week events nationwide, including its military band. Millán-Astray provided the Legion with a distinctive spirit and symbolism intended to evoke Spain's Imperial and Christian traditions. For instance, the Legion adopted the regimental designation of tercio in memory of the 16th-century Spanish infantry formations that had toppled nations and terrorised the battlefields of Europe in the days of Charles V. Millán-Astray also revived the Spaniards' ancient feud with the Moors and portrayed his men first as crusaders on an extended Reconquista against the Islamic civilization, and later as the saviours of Spain warding off the twin evils of Communism and democratic liberalism defeating the dangerous spectre of 'Eastern Atheism'."

The Spanish Navy Marines is an elite corps, highly specialised in amphibious warfare, that is, to project an amphibious force onto a hostile, or potentially hostile, coast. Its ability to embark on a short term notice with (land, air and naval) Navy assets, makes it a unit with a high strategic value. Adding to this a high degree of training, and the capability to deploy swiftly in international waters, results in a potent dissuasive force available at a short notice in distant regions. One of the main characteristics of a marine is the uniform that he wears. On the sleeves of the Spanish Marines are the three "Sardinetas", which marks it as a member of the Royal House Corps. This was given in recognition for a heroic last stand in the Castillo del Morro of Havana, Cuba against a British expedition in 1762.

It is an expression of the conflict between the "progressive forces of socialism" and the "reactionary forces of imperialist capitalism," which they believe will ultimately be resolved in favour of socialism. The Communist concept of war represents a continuation of politics. In Western perceptions, war occurs when politics fails to resolve conflicts nonviolently. Communists feel that war is the least desirable method by which the forces of history will move toward full victory for socialism. Communist political and military theorists compare the socialist and capitalist fields with a concept called "correlation of forces." This concept compares the relative political, moral, economic and military forces of both sides. In the communist vision, the correlation of forces has changed in favour of the capitalist camp. The Marxist-Leninist ideology requires that the correlation continually change in favour of socialism. The correlation of forces can be promoted by both violent and non-violent means.

 spain.325.d:0 "With the promulgation of the National Defense Law, Spain has adopted a total military doctrine of war called Total People's Defense (DTP). Inspired by the wars of popular liberation against the fascist occupiers and their collaborators in the different warlike conflicts, it has been designed to allow Spain to maintain or eventually reestablish its independent state if an invasion occurs. Any citizen who resists an aggressor is a member of the armed forces, so the whole population could become an army of monolithic resistance. From primary education, secondary schools, universities, organisations and enterprises, the authorities prepare the entire population to challenge a possible occupation of the country and finally to release it. To this end, the Territorial Defense Forces (FDT) would be formed to mobilise the population in case of aggression. Preparation for FDT combat means that steps of organisation and training could be avoided after the outbreak of hostilities. The Territorial Defense Forces would complement the regular Armed Forces of the Republic, giving it greater defensive depth and an armed local population willing to support combat actions. A large number of armed civilians would increase the cost of an invasion of a potential aggressor. The most likely scenario in the DTP doctrine is a general war between NATO and the CSTO. In such a situation, Spain would remain non-aligned, and would not accept foreign troops from any of the alliances in its territory. The doctrine recognizes the probability that one side or the other will try to appropriate the national territory as an advanced area, to secure lines of communication or simply to deny the territory to enemy forces. Such an action would be considered aggression and would be resisted. The occupiers would be considered the enemy of the Republic."

It is the Spanish rule that regulates the entry and stay of non-EU foreigners in Spanish territory, as well as the rights and freedoms that are recognized. Its current Development Regulation was approved by Royal Decree 2393/2004 of 30 December. On 30 June 2011 it was replaced by the new Development Regulation, approved by Royal Decree 557/2011, of 20 April (BOE of 30 April). The Law comprises seventy-one articles structured in five titles. The Preliminary Title contains general provisions and the others refer respectively to the rights and freedoms of foreigners, their legal regime, violations of aliens and the sanctioning procedure and coordination of public powers. Traditionally, Spain has been a country of emigration, so legislative production has focused on this area, while legislation relating to foreigners was fragmentary. The first attempt to alleviate this occurred with Organic Law 7/1985, of 1 July, on the Rights and Freedoms of Foreigners, which was strongly criticised for its police treatment of the migratory phenomenon, its restrictive regulation on the rights of Foreigners and the poor legal technique that showed. Spain, which was soon to join the then European Community, tried to avoid becoming the gateway to the continent: some social organisations denounced that it was the hardest norm in Europe. The Law was the subject of an unconstitutionality appeal, settled by Constitutional Court Judgment 115/1987, of July 7, which overturned several precepts of the norm and marked a change of constitutional doctrine regarding foreigners towards a more progressive line. The deficiencies of the Law and the transformation of the migratory phenomenon in Spain at the end of the 1980s and in the 1990s showed the need for a new law adapted to the circumstances, favouring immigration in order to reduce the labour force by increasing Their available number. Since 2000, Spain has exhibited one of the highest annual immigration rates in the world (three to four times higher than the average rate in the United States, eight times more than in France, and in 2005 it was only surpassed in relative terms In the European continent by Cyprus and Andorra.)"

Since then, the pressure on the border of Ceuta and Melilla has registered multiple variations. 2005 was a critical year and gave rise to what was called the "crisis of the fences". That year, more than 5,500 immigrants accessed Spanish territory through the fences of Ceuta and Melilla, and attempts were made to mass assault with several groups of up to 600 immigrants jumping simultaneously. However, 2006 was the year of the so-called "cayucos crisis". The Spanish coasts were flooded with the arrival of 39,180 irregular, mainly Canaries. For a long time the Moroccans constituted the first important foreign community, around one million, but in 2007 (which has experienced a setback in recent years due to the granting of Spanish nationality to tens of thousands of Moroccan citizens) became the Second largest community after Romanians. Moroccans have spread throughout the national territory. Sub-Saharan immigration in Spain was always quantitatively very limited. This situation began to change in the 1990s, when a greater influx of Africans from southern Sahara began to arrive in Melilla. In January 1998, some 36,000 people were born in sub-Saharan Africa, but it would not be until the years after the 1996 regularisation of the first "boom" of sub-Saharan immigration and its access to the Spanish labour market, Which will focus mainly on sectors such as agriculture, construction, services and street commerce, sectors characterised by low wages and precarious employment conditions. Between January 1998 and January 2003, the arrival of sub-Saharan immigrants has tripled to 110,000. In 2010 the figure was 237 309 and all the variables indicate a trend towards the diversification of the countries of origin. Irregularity and family reunification have been the most widely used forms of access to Spain, which means that the first years in Spain are characterised by precariousness and access to the informal labour market."

The city centre was crowded for hours and it was feared that the massive influx of people might bring the mobile phone network to a standstill. Many newspapers and other news agencies described it as a "historic" demonstration and considered it to be the biggest protest march ever held in Catalonia since the restoration of democracy in Spain, surpassing other major demonstrations, including the 2010 Catalan autonomy protest."

The CUP gave a "critical yes" vote with 1 vote in favour and 2 abstentions. On May 8, 2013, the Constitutional Court suspended this statement in a precautionary manner by admitting the challenge presented by the State's Lawyer, which considered it an "act of constituent power" and "an open challenge against the Constitution." In March 2014, the Constitutional Court finally ruled that this declaration of sovereignty was "unconstitutional and null", and therefore did not support the holding of a referendum on self-determination in Catalonia.75 Nevertheless, the Government of the Generalitat minimised the impact of judgement."

The Government of Spain opposes any regional self-determination referendum, maintaining that the Spanish Constitution does not allow for a vote on the independence of any Spanish region while also deeming it as illegal without its consent; an interpretation also favoured by the not binding Catalan Statutory Guarantees Council. In the absence of constitutional grounds, the Catalan government invokes the right to self-determination for calling the referendum. However, the Council of Europe, when consulted by Carles Puigdemont, president of Catalan government, said that any referendum must be carried out “in full compliance with the constitution”. So far, the Catalan government has tried but failed to get international support; in particular, Spain’s European partners see Catalonia’s status as a strictly internal matter. The Catalan government plans to thwart legal action on behalf of the Spanish government by rushing a referendum law through its own parliament, by simple majority, in September declaring that it will then follow a "Catalan-only" legality (as opposed to the general Spanish one).

From 1827 to 1843, the United Kingdom had a base on Bioko to combat the continuing Atlantic slave trade conducted by Spain and illegal traders. Based on an agreement with Spain in 1843, Britain moved its base to its own colony of Sierra Leone in West Africa. In 1844, on restoration of Spanish sovereignty, it became known as the "Territorios Españoles del Golfo de Guinea". Spain had never undertaken colonial settlement of the large area in the Bight of Biafra to which it had treaty rights. The French expanded their occupation at the expense of the area claimed by Spain.

Buenos Aires, located on the western shore of the Río de la Plata estuary flowing into the Atlantic Ocean, opposite the Portuguese outpost of Colonia del Sacramento, was chosen as the capital. Usually considered one of the late Bourbon Reforms, the organisation of this viceroyalty was motivated on both commercial grounds (Buenos Aires was by then a major spot for illegal trade), as well as on security concerns brought about by the growing interest of competing foreign powers in the area.

Employing Vinicio Alvarado as his campaign manager, Correa's campaign emphasised his personality as a macho family man of modest origins who was angry with the country's political elites. During his campaign, he described himself as the head of "a citizen's revolution" against the established political parties and corrupt elites, and depicted himself as the leader of a second independence movement devoted to freeing Ecuador from American imperialism. Touring the country aboard a motorised caravan attending political rallies, he emphasised this opposition using campaign songs such as Twisted Sister's "We're Not Gonna Take It", as well as through the slogan "Se viene el correazo" ("Here comes a whipping"), a pun on the fact that "Correa" can be translated as whip. However, the Alianza PAIS movement signed a political alliance with the Ecuadorian Socialist Party, which did present candidates for Congress. On 31 July 2006, Alianza PAIS also signed a Programmatic Political Agreement with the Communist Party of Ecuador when Correa was postulated as a candidate for president. Other parties that joined Alianza PAIS coalition in a runoff election included: Democratic People's Movement, Democratic Left, Pachakutik, and the Partido Roldista Ecuatoriano. In the October 2006 general election, Correa obtained second place (23%) behind banana tycoon Álvaro Noboa (27%). The situation led to a run-off election, in which Correa portrayed Noboa as an exploitative oligarch and Noboa portrayed Correa as a dangerous leftist with strong links to Venezuela. Correa won the subsequent November 2006 runoff election with 57% of the vote. Correa was the first leftist to assume the presidency since Ecuador's transition to representative democratic governance in 1979."

One sector has managed to maintain almost unchanged its preponderance in the selective index of the Spanish stock market: the banking sector. At the outset, Banco Central Hispano, BBV, Santander, Banesto and Banco Exterior were among the top ten index values. Through mergers and internationalisation processes, the financial sector has lighted some of the largest companies in the Spanish market.

Will soon become the socialist reflection of the popular think tank. They exist in all the countries that have had some imperialist objective in its history, like the United States, France or Spain. But this legacy is not only in the hands of party organisations. These foundations are divided between public ones, created directly by the State, like the Instituto Cervantes or the Carolina Foundation; And the private ones, related to parties, companies and Church. In organisations linked to the parties themselves or to the state itself, the participation of large companies is crucial for their financing, either with managers on their boards or with the direct presence of multinationals, such as the Carolina Foundation, Which together with AECI's money has the contributions of Santander, BBVA, Endesa, PRISA and, thus, to a total of 25 Spanish multinationals. With different means but similar objectives are other institutions like the Cervantes Institute or related NGOs, such as Solidarity (PSOE) or Humanism and Democracy (PP).

However, shortly after taking office, Rajoy's People's Party (PP) popularity in opinion polls began to erode after its U-turn on economic policy, which included the breaching of many election pledges. In its first months in power, Rajoy's government approved a series of tax rises, a harsh labour reform that allegedly cheapened dismissals—and which was met with widespread protests and two general strikes in March and November 2012—and an austere state budget for 2012. The crash of Bankia, one of the largest banks of Spain, in May 2012 resulted in a dramatic rise of the Spanish risk premium, and in June the country's banking system needed a bailout from the IMF. The social response to the ongoing political and economic crisis was mixed. The 15-M Movement had resulted in an increase of street protests and demonstrations calling for a more democratic governmental system, a halt to spending cuts and tax increases and an overall rejection of Spain's two-party system formed by both PP and PSOE. Social mobilisation channelled through various protest actions, such as "Surround the Congress", the so-called "Citizen Tides" or the "Marches for Dignity". In Catalonia, the PP's rise to power and its perceived rightist stance were said to have been the final trigger for the independence movement to fire up. A 1.5-million strong demonstration in Barcelona on 11 September 2012 finally convinced the regional ruling Convergence and Union (CiU) of Artur Mas to switch to independence support. Finally, the PP decline and the PSOE inability to recover lost support paved the way for the rise of new parties in the national landscape, such as Podemos and Citizens (C's), which began to rise dramatically in opinion polls after the 2014 European Parliament election."

 spain.450.t:0 "Reform of the Electoral System"
 spain.450.d:0 "We believe that one of the biggest failures of Spanish democracy is the electoral system. It is a failure because it has illuminated a de facto bipartisanship that does not represent the variety of currents of thought present in society. The political framework generated by this electoral system favours a high bureaucratization and is impervious to democratic control of society. In the same way, the substitution of all public financing by private financing has been adopted, but it is transparent and deductible as long as the current fiscal framework persists, it has been reformed so that the direct vote to people, without lists, guarantees the vote by priority."

 spain.451.d:0 "In the question of Gibraltar the previous Spanish governments have insisted that the dispute is completely bilateral and that those who live in the colony are English settlers. This principle was reflected in the resolution of the UN Decolonization Committee.

 spain.455.t:0 "Legalisation of drugs"
 spain.455.d:0 "The legalisation of drugs recognizes the right of people to consume any substance and, accompanied with education, is possibly the best strategy to fight against abusive consumption and drug addiction, causes of human degradation of the consumer and multiple damages to their environment . The illegalization of drugs is not solving the problems that drug use generates in public health and is fomenting other equally serious problems such as drug trafficking and the dubious governmental policies of war against drug trafficking. The legal fight against drugs has focused, worldwide, on the prohibition, repression and punishment of its use (with the exception of tobacco and alcohol). The illegalization of drugs violates rights such as individual self-determination and the free development of personality, so publicised by the current systems of government."
 spain.455.o1:0 "Excellent"
 spain.456.t:0 "Legalisation of Prostitution"
 spain.456.d:0 "As a potential means to displace sex trafficking, legalising prostitution has an obvious appeal. In addition to being a desirable policy among many of those who engage in prostitution on a consensual basis, legalisation is assumed to help the market crowd out violent clients, abusive pimps and evil traffickers. Advocates argue that making it legal to sell sex increases the supply of consensual prostitution whereas making it legal to buy sex attracts better-behaving consumers—both of which should make the market for commercial sex less exploitative. This line of reasoning makes sense, and is also what basic economic theory would predict. But on the part of the Government, the recent legalisation of prostitution has taken precedence over the ideological principles of liberalism and individual freedom."

Because of the credit crunch caused by the 2007 crisis, the GUFs have gained media notoriety in the bailouts of major Wall Street listed banking groups such as Citigroup or Merrill Lynch, uncovering their large financial resources. The largest, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), manages assets estimated at $ 875,000 million, about 3 times the Swiss GDP in 2007. On the part of the current Executive it has been decided to create the Government of Spain Investment Corporation (GSIC) with the object of capitalising all those statal sectors that are being liberalised in order to be a useful instrument to manage the international reserves of Spain."

 SPR_actividad_armada_ETA_desc:0 "ETA, an acronym for Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (Basque: "Basque Homeland and Liberty"), is a formerly armed leftist Basque nationalist and separatist organisation in the Basque Country (in northern Spain and southwestern France). The group was founded in 1959 and later evolved from a group promoting traditional Basque culture to a paramilitary group engaged in a violent campaign of bombing, assassinations and kidnappings in the Southern Basque Country and throughout Spanish territory. Its goal was gaining independence for the Basque Country. ETA is the main group within the Basque National Liberation Movement and is the most important Basque participant in the Basque conflict. Since 1968, it has killed over 820 people (including 340 civilians) and injured thousands more. ETA is proscribed as a terrorist group by Spain, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union. This convention is followed by a plurality of domestic and international media, which also refer to the group as "terrorists". There are more than 300 imprisoned members of the group in Spain, France, and other countries. ETA's motto is Bietan jarrai ("Keep up on both"), referring to the two figures in its symbol, a snake (representing politics) wrapped around an axe (representing armed struggle)."

 SPR_flujos_migratorios:0 "Migratory Flows"
 SPR_flujos_migratorios_desc:0 "The law on foreigners is the name with which the Organic Law 4/2000, of January 11, on the Rights and Freedoms of Foreigners in Spain and its Social Integration, modified by LO 8/2000, 14/2003 and 2/2009. It is the Spanish rule that regulates the entry and stay of non-EU foreigners in Spanish territory, as well as the rights and freedoms that are recognized. Its current Development Regulation was approved by Royal Decree 2393/2004 of 30 December. On 30 June 2011 it was replaced by the new Development Regulation, approved by Royal Decree 557/2011, of 20 April (BOE of 30 April). The Law comprises seventy-one articles structured in five titles. The Preliminary Title contains general provisions and the others refer respectively to the rights and freedoms of foreigners, their legal regime, violations of aliens and the sanctioning procedure and coordination of public powers. Traditionally, Spain has been a country of emigration, so legislative production has focused on this area, while legislation relating to foreigners was fragmentary. The first attempt to alleviate this occurred with Organic Law 7/1985, of 1 July, on the Rights and Freedoms of Foreigners, which was strongly criticised for its police treatment of the migratory phenomenon, its restrictive regulation on the rights of Foreigners and the poor legal technique that showed. Spain, which was soon to join the then European Community, tried to avoid becoming the gateway to the continent: some social organisations denounced that it was the hardest norm in Europe. The Law was the subject of an unconstitutionality appeal, settled by Constitutional Court Judgment 115/1987, of July 7, which overturned several precepts of the norm and marked a change of constitutional doctrine regarding foreigners towards a more progressive line. The deficiencies of the Law and the transformation of the migratory phenomenon in Spain at the end of the 1980s and in the 1990s showed the need for a new law adapted to the circumstances, favouring immigration in order to reduce the labour force by increasing Their available number. Since 2000, Spain has exhibited one of the highest annual immigration rates in the world (three to four times higher than the average rate in the United States, eight times more than in France, and in 2005 it was only surpassed in relative terms In the European continent by Cyprus and Andorra.)"
 SPR_emigracion_africana:0 "African Immigration"
 SPR_emigracion_africana_desc:0 "In 2004 was recorded the first assault to the fence, in Melilla. Since then, the pressure on the border of Ceuta and Melilla has registered multiple variations. 2005 was a critical year and gave rise to what was called the "crisis of the fences". That year, more than 5,500 immigrants accessed Spanish territory through the fences of Ceuta and Melilla, and attempts were made to mass assault with several groups of up to 600 immigrants jumping simultaneously. However, 2006 was the year of the so-called "cayucos crisis". The Spanish coasts were flooded with the arrival of 39,180 irregular, mainly Canaries. For a long time the Moroccans constituted the first important foreign community, around one million, but in 2007 (which has experienced a setback in recent years due to the granting of Spanish nationality to tens of thousands of Moroccan citizens) became the Second largest community after Romanians. Moroccans have spread throughout the national territory. Sub-Saharan immigration in Spain was always quantitatively very limited. This situation began to change in the 1990s, when a greater influx of Africans from southern Sahara began to arrive in Melilla. In January 1998, some 36,000 people were born in sub-Saharan Africa, but it would not be until the years after the 1996 regularisation of the first "boom" of sub-Saharan immigration and its access to the Spanish labour market, Which will focus mainly on sectors such as agriculture, construction, services and street commerce, sectors characterised by low wages and precarious employment conditions. Between January 1998 and January 2003, the arrival of sub-Saharan immigrants has tripled to 110,000. In 2010 the figure was 237 309 and all the variables indicate a trend towards the diversification of the countries of origin. Irregularity and family reunification have been the most widely used forms of access to Spain, which means that the first years in Spain are characterised by precariousness and access to the informal labour market."

Only a year after winning the elections, in 1997, the PP began to sell. Under his mandate, the main companies in sectors of major importance in the Spanish economy, such as electricity, gas, oil, transport, telecommunications, were privatised. In total, some 50 companies were privatised, leaving an income of 30 billion euros Euros, of which more than 22,000 million correspond to IPOs. In 1996, the deficit was 5.5% and public debt amounted to 67.4%. According to the University of Oviedo study cited above, with Felipe González, the annual revenues obtained from privatisations represented only 10% of the deficit, while in 1997 and 1998 (with Aznar) the proportion increased to 60-75% , "Which contributed to the reduction of the deficit and public debt and to enable Spain to meet the Maastricht requirement of reducing the fiscal deficit to below 3% of GDP. Not everyone agrees with this supposed economic miracle of Aznar, since privatisations usually serve to reduce the level of public debt but not the structural deficit, since they only produce income in the year of sale. Aznar, the king of privatisations, later found accommodation in one of the companies he privatised, Endesa. As much other ex-politics.

 SPR_burbuja_inmobiliaria_idea_desc:0 "Economic indexes began to rise from 1995, bringing an expansionary phase that lasted until early 2008, with an average annual GDP increase of 3.5%, which has been the period of highest growth since 1975. The reasons Which have been enunciated mainly as drivers of this prolonged period of economic boom were basically two: First, the incorporation of Spain to the Monetary Union. The entry into force of the second phase of the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union in 1994 led to a drop in interest rates, which was accentuated by the introduction of the euro as an official currency instead of the peseta. In 2002. The fall in interest rates and the absence of exchange rate risk within the euro zone led to negative real interest rates and encouraged an increase in investor confidence and a Which led to an increase in the demand for housing and durable consumer goods and subsequently to an increase in investment and employment of companies favoured by this increased demand. This fall in interest rates also led to the birth of the so-called housing bubble, which inflated the price of housing with increases during this period of more than 30% in real terms. The second cause of Spain's expansion was a massive influx of immigrants, mainly from 2002, attracted by a growing demand for employment in the construction sector and some low-level basic services such as hospitality and domestic service. This arrival brought a new impulse to consumption and Spanish investment and at the same time prevented bottlenecks due to lack of labour in certain sectors. These factors were capable of overcoming an international period characterised by rising energy and other commodity prices as well as the development of increasing international competition. At the end of 2007, typical problems of an excess of global demand with a dragged inflation higher in a point to the one of the eurozone, a very swollen housing bubble and a large deficit of the balance were evident in the economy of Spain. By the current account, which became the second highest in the world, after the United States, caused by the very strong increase in investment in Spain that resulted in a high foreign indebtedness, also came this year with an economy Very unbalanced towards the construction sector and inefficient with a very deteriorated productivity that together made unsustainable the maintenance of the growth rates carried until that year."
 SPR_ibex_idea:0 "The Metamorphosis of Ibex"
 SPR_ibex_idea_desc:0 "In its origins, the Ibex was a faithful reflection of an economy immersed in a deep process of adjustment and modernization to achieve convergence with the European countries. In this, two very regulated sectors, the banking and the electric ones, had a very significant weight - both represented more than 70% of the index - and the public sector was very present through companies like Telefónica, Endesa, Iberia, Repsol or Tabacalera. The 35 companies present in those first measures of the index had a joint value equivalent to 51,382 million euros. Twenty-five years later, the Ibex 35 has multiplied by more than ten its capitalization, figures that speak clearly of the growth experienced in this period by the Spanish economy and its companies and which has also been reflected in a revaluation of the rate of 255% - 790% if you take into account the dividends paid by your companies. One sector has managed to maintain almost unchanged its preponderance in the selective index of the Spanish stock market: the banking sector. At the outset, Banco Central Hispano, BBV, Santander, Banesto and Banco Exterior were among the top ten index values. Through mergers and internationalisation processes, the financial sector has lighted some of the largest companies in the Spanish market. The witness of Telefónica as the most valuable company of the Ibex has been collected by Inditex. The textile company has been one of the most noteworthy success stories in the Spanish market in recent years and has reached a market value close to 100,000 million euros. Firms such as Iberdrola, Endesa and Repsol are today among the most important of the Ibex 35. And others, such as Gas Natural and Red Eléctrica, which were not present in the origins of the selective also currently has a considerable weight."
 SPR_fundaciones_idea:0 "The Tentacles of the «RealPolitik»"
 SPR_fundaciones_idea_desc:0 "PP and PSOE have gone from having different institutions to coordinating them around an important think tank. In this work, the innovation was marked by José María Aznar and his Foundation for Analysis and Social Studies (FAES), when, at the end of 2002, five foundations linked to the Popular Party were integrated, leaving only the NGO Humanism And Democracy. A similar process would now be underway for the Pablo Iglesias Foundation, Spanish in the World, Jaime Vera, System and Global Progress, institutions that are closer to the PSOE and could be integrated into Equality, Rights, Ecology, Action and Solidarity, which form the acronym IDEAS. Will soon become the socialist reflection of the popular think tank. They exist in all the countries that have had some imperialist objective in its history, like the United States, France or Spain. But this legacy is not only in the hands of party organisations. These foundations are divided between public ones, created directly by the State, like the Instituto Cervantes or the Carolina Foundation; And the private ones, related to parties, companies and Church. In organisations linked to the parties themselves or to the state itself, the participation of large companies is crucial for their financing, either with managers on their boards or with the direct presence of multinationals, such as the Carolina Foundation, Which together with AECI's money has the contributions of Santander, BBVA, Endesa, PRISA and, thus, to a total of 25 Spanish multinationals. With different means but similar objectives are other institutions like the Cervantes Institute or related NGOs, such as Solidarity (PSOE) or Humanism and Democracy (PP). The Cervantes, along with the Spanish language, exports the venerable image of parliamentary monarchy, the Transition and all the transcendental questions of State. An example of this is the absence of Cervantes in the territories of the former Spanish province of Western Sahara, while there are five of its centres in Morocco, which occupied the former colony."

The Spanish government supported the critical development by relaxing supervision of the financial sector and thereby allowing the banks to violate International Accounting Standards Board standards. The banks in Spain were able to hide losses and earnings volatility, mislead regulators, analysts, and investors, and thereby finance the Spanish real estate bubble. The results of the crisis were devastating for Spain, including a strong economic downturn, a severe increase in unemployment, and bankruptcies of major companies."

The reform had the support of the two major parties, Partido Popular and Partido Socialista Obrero Español, as well as Unión del Pueblo Navarro.

 SPR_crisis_inmobiliaria_idea_desc:0 "The origin of this crisis, framed in the context of a global economic-financial crisis, was strongly influenced by the strong adjustment of the construction industry after the bursting of the housing bubble. It is considered that the housing bubble began during the government of J. M. Aznar, in the years before Zapatero's term. The lowering of the price of housing coupled with unemployment means that many citizens can not take over their mortgages, or even sell their real estate. This situation occurs because in areas where prices have been "inflated" much, the current price of housing is lower than the mortgage debt incurred. Thus, numerous embargoes of local and second homes, as well as evictions of first homes are being carried out during this period of crisis."

 SPR_burbuja_turistica_idea_desc:0 "The reasons for this worsening of the distributive panorama are several and are due to factors that go beyond the change of economic cycle. In the first place, a basic economic problem linked to an uncompetitive productive structure persists. In the last decades, job creation has been closely linked to very cyclical sectors and the evidence shows that we need relatively high rates of GDP growth to create new jobs. Second, we have a serious structural problem of inequality and vulnerability. Already before the crisis there was a very large percentage of the population with incomes only slightly above the poverty line and very dependent on the dragging effect of the expansion of certain economic activities. Thirdly, we have not been able to consolidate a sufficiently robust protection network, facing the crisis with a very fragmented income guarantee system, with significant gaps in coverage and with large territorial inequalities in the response offered to situations of Insufficient income."

In November 2003, Ala 12 flight hours on the Hornet exceeded 100,000, a total greater than that flown by any of the unit's previous aircraft types. Ala 12's Hornets were the first Spanish aircraft to undergo a mid-life update, and in 2006, 122 Squadron was recognized by NATO with an operational evaluation rating of "Mission Capable". 121 Squadron was deployed to Decimomannu Air Base on the island of Sardinia in Italy with four planes to constitute Detachment Argos. They provided the initial Spanish contingent of NATO forces in Operation Odyssey Dawn, the American-led portion of the 2011 military intervention in Libya, from 19–28 March 2011. Following this, they participated in NATO's Operation Unified Protector until mid-May 2011 when relieved by 122 Squadron, which was in turn relieved by Ala 15 on 6 July 2011."

 EPR_doctrina_militar_desc:0 "For the Communists, war is a manifestation of the class struggle. It is an expression of the conflict between the "progressive forces of socialism" and the "reactionary forces of imperialist capitalism," which they believe will ultimately be resolved in favour of socialism. The Communist concept of war represents a continuation of politics. In Western perceptions, war occurs when politics fails to resolve conflicts nonviolently. Communists feel that war is the least desirable method by which the forces of history will move toward full victory for socialism. Communist political and military theorists compare the socialist and capitalist fields with a concept called "correlation of forces." This concept compares the relative political, moral, economic and military forces of both sides. In the communist vision, the correlation of forces has changed in favour of the capitalist camp. The Marxist-Leninist ideology requires that the correlation continually change in favour of socialism. The correlation of forces can be promoted by both violent and non-violent means. When it is advanced by violent means, the military component of the correlation is the dominant factor. Military doctrine contains two dimensions - sociopolitical and military-technical. The sociopolitical dimension, which derives from the class nature of a society, constitutes the basic framework of a state's national security policy and is formulated by the political leadership. The military-technical dimension is formulated within the sociopolitical framework. It focuses on the structure of the armed forces, their equipment and training, and planning for the conduct of war. Military-technical doctrine takes into account the conclusions of military theory and practice and is largely the preserve of the professional military leadership. Because of the character of their concerns and the division of responsibilities within the socialism system, political and military authorities look at the same issue from different angles, and on occasion derive what appear to be contradictory conclusions. An example of such an apparent contradiction is the traditional characterization of military doctrine as both defensive and offensive."

 EPR_defensa_total_pueblo:0 "Total People's Defence"
 EPR_defensa_total_pueblo_desc:0 "With the promulgation of the National Defense Law, Spain has adopted a total military doctrine of war called Total People's Defense (DTP). Inspired by the wars of popular liberation against the fascist occupiers and their collaborators in the different warlike conflicts, it has been designed to allow Spain to maintain or eventually reestablish its independent state if an invasion occurs. Any citizen who resists an aggressor is a member of the armed forces, so the whole population could become an army of monolithic resistance. From primary education, secondary schools, universities, organisations and enterprises, the authorities prepare the entire population to challenge a possible occupation of the country and finally to release it. To this end, the Territorial Defense Forces (FDT) would be formed to mobilise the population in case of aggression. Preparation for FDT combat means that steps of organisation and training could be avoided after the outbreak of hostilities. The Territorial Defense Forces would complement the regular Armed Forces of the Republic, giving it greater defensive depth and an armed local population willing to support combat actions. A large number of armed civilians would increase the cost of an invasion of a potential aggressor. The most likely scenario in the DTP doctrine is a general war between NATO and the CSTO. In such a situation, Spain would remain non-aligned, and would not accept foreign troops from any of the alliances in its territory. The doctrine recognizes the probability that one side or the other will try to appropriate the national territory as an advanced area, to secure lines of communication or simply to deny the territory to enemy forces. Such an action would be considered aggression and would be resisted. The occupiers would be considered the enemy of the Republic."

General weapon systems include missiles, aircraft, tanks, and artillery. These systems are designed to destroy a wide variety of battlefield targets, but may be employed successfully against tanks and other armoured vehicles. According to the AFR, any artillery-type weapon (over 20 mm) should have an anti armour capability. All conventional artillery up to 152-mm calibre has good direct fire antitank capability and carries some armour-defeating ammunition. The 122-mm towed and SP howitzers and the 152-mm SP howitzer with their 360 degree traverse are particularly effective in this role. Field artillery often is used for direct fire. Anti Aircraft guns could engage ground targets if required. Special antitank weapon systems consist of anti tank guided missiles (ATGMs), anti tank guns, grenade launchers, and recoilless guns. These Weapons are designed specifically to destroy tanks and their crews by direct fire. The AFR consider ATGMs to be very effective anti tank weapons, but limited by minimum ranges, low rate of fire, and visibility requirements. AFR antitank forces therefore have been structured with a mix of ATGMs and direct fire weapons (guns and grenade launchers). The direct fire weapons provide quick-response fires at medium, short, and point-blank ranges, on broken ground, and under favourable visibility conditions."

Juan Carlos is the grandson of Alfonso XIII, the last king of Spain prior to the monarchy's abolition in 1931 and the subsequent declaration of the Second Spanish Republic. Juan Carlos was born in Rome, Italy, during his family's exile. Following his victory in the Spanish Civil War in 1939, Generalísimo Francisco Franco, the Spanish dictator, took over the government of Spain and in 1947, Spain's status as a monarchy was affirmed and a law was passed allowing Franco to choose his successor. Juan Carlos's father, Don Juan, was the fourth child of Alfonso, who had renounced his claims to the throne in January 1941. Don Juan was seen by Franco to be too liberal and in 1969, was bypassed in favour of Juan Carlos as Franco's successor and next head of state. uan Carlos spent his early years in Italy and came to Spain in 1947 to continue his studies. After completing his secondary education in 1955, he began his military training and entered the General Military Academy at Zaragoza. Later, he attended the Naval Military School, the General Academy of the Air, and finished his tertiary education at the University of Madrid. In 1962, Juan Carlos married Princess Sophia of Greece in Athens, daughter of King Paul. The couple had two daughters and a son together: Elena, Cristina, and Felipe. Due to Franco's declining health, Juan Carlos first began periodically acting as Spain's head of state in the summer of 1974. Franco died in November the following year and Juan Carlos became king on 22 November 1975, two days after Franco's death, the first reigning monarch since 1931; although his exiled father did not formally renounce his claims to the throne in favour of his son until 1977. Expected to continue Franco's legacy, Juan Carlos, however, soon after his accession introduced reforms to dismantle the Francoist regime and begin the Spanish transition to democracy. This led to the approval of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 in a referendum, which re-established a constitutional monarchy. In 1981, Juan Carlos played a major role in preventing a coup that attempted to revert Spain to Francoist government in the King's name. In 2008, he was considered the most popular leader in all Ibero-America. Hailed for his role in Spain's transition to democracy, the King and the monarchy's reputation began to suffer after controversies surrounding his family arose, exacerbated by an elephant-hunting trip he undertook during a time of financial crisis in Spain.

Sixto Enrique de Borbón-Parma and Borbón-Busset was born in the French city of Pau on July 22, 1940, the second of the men of Francisco Javier de Borbón-Parma (claimant of the Spanish throne) and Maria Magdalena de Borbón-Busset. He studied in several religious schools, completing his training later with studies of Law, classical and modern languages ​​and finances. Under the false name of Enrique Aranjuez, in 1965 he enlisted in the third Great Captain, 1st of the Legion. On May 2 of that year he swore a flag, but on discovering his identity he was expelled from the Legion and from Spain. After the transfer of control of the party in 1972 from his father to his brother Carlos Hugo, the differences with him were accentuated, mainly due to the ideological change of the new Carlista Party, led by his brother towards self-managed socialism. Finally, the more traditionalist sectors of the movement were separated. The rupture was made public by a letter addressed by Sixto to his brother, on September 22, 1975, in which he accused him of betraying Carlist ideals. In August of 1975 Sixto had already initiated a political tour by Spain. Although the government order of expulsion against the entire Borbón-Parma family was still in force, Sixto moved through Spanish territory with a passport issued at the Consulate of Bayonne, while traditionalist or similar newspapers such as El Alcázar, El Pensamiento Navarro, Compass, Church World, what is happening ?, promote the Sistine campaign of "Reconquista de Montejurra", which also echoes the press of the Movement. In the spring of 1976, in the pilgrimage of Montejurra, a heterogeneous "sixtino" group, made up of members of the new Traditionalist Communion, the Brotherhood of Ex-combatants, Spanish National Union and Fuerza Nueva, accompanied by Spanish, Argentine, Italian and Spanish right-wing gunmen. French attacked the militants of the new Carlista Party, supporters of Carlos Hugo, when they tried to recover the traditional Viacrucis for traditionalism, resulting in the deaths of two people. According to José Arturo Márquez de Prado, one of the main traditionalist Sixts who came to Montejurra, there were also members of ETA who accompanied the members of the Carlista Party, with supporters of Sixtus of Bourbon machine gun blasts. In 2001 he published a manifesto calling for the regrouping of the Carlists, in which he emphasised the providential mission of Carlism. The unequal marriages of his nephews Carlos Javier de Borbón-Parma (2010) and Jaime Bernardo de Borbón-Parma (2013), would have legitimised the claims of Sixto Enrique as being contrary to the provisions of the Pragmatic Sanction of 1776.

 POLITICIAN_SPR_JOSE_MARIA_AZNAR_DESC:0 "José María Alfredo Aznar López (Madrid, February 25, 1953) is a Spanish politician, president of the Government of Spain from 1996 to 2004. He is a member of the Popular Party, of which he was president between 1990 and 2004. As a teenager, Aznar was a member of the Frente de Estudiantes Sindicalistas (FES), a Student Union supporting the Falange, Franco's one-party fascist organisation. After 1977 it would become Falange Española Independiente (FEI). After the death of Francisco Franco and the restoration of democracy, Aznar joined Alianza Popular (AP) in January 1979, a few months after his wife. In March he became the Secretary General of the party in La Rioja, occupying the post until 1980. In February 1981 he joined the AP's National executive committee. He became Assistant Secretary General in February 1982. On 26 October 1982 he was elected to parliament, representing Ávila. On 22 June 1985 he was elected to the presidency of the AP in Castile and León. On 2 December 1986 AP leader Manuel Fraga resigned following fierce internal party fighting in the aftermath of another failure to dislodge the ruling Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE). Aznar was not considered senior enough to be a possible successor, and gave his support to the more conservative Miguel Herrero, who lost the leadership battle to Fraga's choice, Antonio Hernández Mancha. As a result, Aznar lost his post as Assistant Secretary General. On 10 June 1987, having resigned his parliamentary seat, he was elected to the Cortes of Castile-León, where he was elected president of this Autonomous Region. Two years later, Aznar was voted by the National Executive Committee to be the new leader of his party, re-founded as the Partido Popular (People's Party, or PP). With Fraga focused on the presidency of Galicia, Aznar was confirmed as leader of the PP at their 10th National Congress at the end of March 1990. In November the PP moved from the Conservative group in the European Parliament to the more centrist Christian Democratic European People's Party. The PP won the 3 March 1996 general election with 37.6% of the vote, thus ending 13 years of PSOE rule. With 156 of the 350 seats (the PSOE won 141) Aznar had to reach agreements with two regional nationalist parties, Convergence and Unity (Catalan) and the Canary Islands Coalition, in order to govern with additional support from the Basque Nationalist Party. He was voted in as Prime Minister with 181 votes in the Cortes Generales on 4 May and sworn in the next day by King Juan Carlos I. Spanish voters reelected Aznar in the 2000 general election with an outright majority. The PP obtained 44.5% of the vote and 183 seats. The Spanish electorate's participation was the lowest for a general election in Spain in the post-Franco era. Amid the relatively stagnant European economies, estimated GDP growth of 2.3% made Spain the second fastest-growing economy in the European Union in 2003. Continued expansion enabled the Spanish government to proclaim proudly that it would end the year with a budget surplus for the first time in recent history. However; inflation was running at 2.7% (compared with the EU's 1.7%) in November, unemployment stood at more than 10%, almost one-third of the workforce had temporary contracts, and housing prices were spiralling. The European Commission shared analysts' concerns that a hike in interest rates or increased unemployment could send housing prices tumbling, with disastrous consequences for families burdened with unprecedented levels of debt and for the financial institutions that had given them loans. After six years of relative political calm, when political debate was dominated by a consensus within the ruling party on economics, regional nationalism, and terrorism, several issues arose which polarised Spanish public opinion. Like UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, Aznar actively supported the United States' War on Terrorism, despite public opposition. Aznar met with Bush in a private meeting before the 2003 invasion of Iraq to discuss the situation in the UN Security Council. El País leaked a partial transcript of the meeting. The government handling of the wreckage of the Greek Prestige tanker near the Spanish coast, which resulted in a major ecological disaster, also became a divisive issue. He actively encouraged and supported the Bush administration's foreign policy and the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, defending it on the basis of secret intelligence allegedly containing evidence of the Iraqi government's nuclear proliferation. The majority of the Spanish population, including some PP members, were against the war. Spain's major cities were the scene of the largest street demonstrations ever seen in the country as a result of the government's participation in the invasion. Aznar lost some support from those who had voted for the PP in 2000. On a live TV interview aired on the public station while demonstrations were taking place on the streets, he asked the Spanish people to take his word assuring there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, of which he had evidence. This is now regarded as incorrect. In January 2004 Aznar called a general election and designated his successor as candidate, Mariano Rajoy, sticking to a pledge of not seeking office for a third term. Despite political tensions, polls suggested that the Popular Party was set to win a third consecutive election on the strength of the economy. An opinion poll carried out by the government-run CIS (which had estimated that 92% of the Spanish people did not support the War in Iraq) in February 2004 estimated that the PP would win an election with 42.2% of the vote while the PSOE would only get 35.5%. Three days before the 2004 general election, 10 bombs killed 191 people in the 11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings. Initially, the government and the opposition stated publicly that it was possible the bombings may have been the work of ETA. However, the PP government continued to blame ETA even after evidence that the attacks may have been the work of an Islamist group emerged, having the Minister of Foreign Affairs Ana Palacio instruct all Spanish diplomats to place the blame on ETA at every opportunity. The public perception that the government hides information from the general population gave rise to a public outcry. Two days after the Atocha bombings, demonstrations took place across Spain demanding news from the investigation, where chants such as "We want the truth before we vote" and "Who is responsible?" were heard. Three days after the train bombings, the opposition PSOE won the elections. The subsequent investigations held by a Parliamentary Committee were characterised by bitter partisan exchanges between the different political parties, with dispute over who may have been responsible for the bombings. Aznar appeared before the Committee in November 2004 and declared his belief that the authors of the bombings were not to be found "in faraway deserts or remote mountains." Aznar said in 2006 that he thought that the attacks were not exclusively perpetrated by Islamists."

His party lost their majority in the 2015 general election, but after that election ended in deadlock, a second election in 2016 enabled Rajoy to be re-elected prime minister as head of a minority government. Rajoy was a Minister under the José María Aznar administration, occupying different leading roles in different Ministries between 1996 and 2003, and he also was the Deputy Prime Minister between 2000 and 2003. He was the Leader of the Opposition between 2004 and 2011 under José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero's government. On 3 March 1996, the PP won the early parliamentary elections and formed a government with the support of the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), Convergence and Union (CiU) and the Canarian Coalition. Rajoy, a long-time associate of newly elected Prime Minister José María Aznar, made the move into national politics in Aznar's first government when he was appointed Minister of Public Administration on 6 May. His term was marked by the adoption, in 1997, of the Law on organisation and operation of the general administration of the State (LOFAGE), which regulates the organisation and functions of central government, and the Law on Government. On 30 August 2003, Aznar announced that he would retire from politics in the 2004 elections and proposed Rajoy as his successor. After the 14th Congress of the People's Party in October 2004, Rajoy became the new Chairman of the party, by then in the opposition, having lost the elections to the PSOE. Rajoy, designated candidate for Prime Minister of the government of King Juan Carlos I, appeared before the Congress of Deputies on 19 December 2011. He stated that to achieve the objective of a deficit of 4.4% of GDP in 2012, an investment of 16.5 billion euros would be needed. He added that his only increased public spending would be the revaluation of pensions, beginning 1 January 2012, and that he would not create any new jobs in the public sector, except for security forces. He stated an intention "to reduce the size of the public sector" and also wanted to reform public holidays so as to avoid encouragement of popular four-day weekends. This would be accomplished by incorporating the use of the nearest Monday for most public holidays. He also announced his desire to end the practice of early retirement. The newspaper El País published in its 30 January 2013 edition a series of documents, under the title of "Bárcenas' secret papers", referring to the accounts of the conservative party from 1999 to 2009. According to those hand-written documents, Mariano Rajoy and María Dolores de Cospedal had received extra payments in "black" money from the former treasurer of the People's Party, Luis Bárcenas. These documents state that both Bárcenas and his predecessor, Álvaro Lapuerta, managed cash donations from businessmen and private builders (three of whom are additionally accused in the Gürtel case), cited as sources of undeclared income of the PP. Expenditure included, apart from allocations for the effective functioning of the party, payments made to members of the leadership of the party during those years with no explicitly stated purpose. Barcenas' accounts show yearly payments of 25,200 euros for 11 years to the President, in addition to smaller amounts for a total estimated at 33,207 with purposes such as "Mariano's suits", "Mariano's ties", or "M.R.'s suits".

The Presidency was divided into two stages, coinciding with the eighth and ninth legislatures of Spanish democracy. During its first stage, the main measures of its government were the withdrawal of the Spanish troops from Iraq, the sending of troops to Afghanistan and the promotion of the Alliance of Civilizations. The political and economic stability of the period 2004-2007 allowed the development of a progressive program with actions such as the legalisation of homosexual marriage, the Law on the promotion of personal autonomy and care for dependents, the Law on Equality Between women and men, the creation of the Violence Courts on Women, a new regularisation of immigrants, the implementation of a series of aid to disadvantaged families, the attempt to peace with ETA, the anti-smoking Law or the reform of the Statutes Of Autonomy, such as that of Catalonia. His second term was heavily marked by the impact of a much more serious and deep economic crisis than his government and most international economic organisations expected. This period of recession, aggravated by the collapse of the financial sector and the collapse of the real estate sector (Spain's main economic and labour engine in the previous fifteen years) led to a sharp deterioration in the national economy and a rapid rise in unemployment To exceed five million unemployed). The Federal Committee of the PSOE celebrated on April 2, 2011 announced that he would not run as a candidate for a hypothetical election in 2012, thus giving up a possible third term. Finally, on July 29, 2011, he announced an electoral advance for November 20 of that same year. One month before the elections, on 20 October, the terrorist organisation ETA announced "the definitive cessation of its armed activity". After leaving the presidency of the Government, the 9 of February of 2012 took possession like a born member of the Council of State. In 2015, he left the Council of State to take the chair of the Advisory Board of the German foundation Institute for Cultural Diplomacy."
 POLITICIAN_SPR_PEDRO_SANCHEZ_DESC:0 "Pedro Sánchez Pérez-Castejón, born 29 February 1972) is a Spanish politician. He is currently leader (Secretary-General) of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE). He first held the post from 2014 to October 2016 when, as a result of tensions within the party, he stood down to be replaced by a caretaker committee. After winning a leadership election, he was back in post from June 2017. Under his leadership the party is expected to depart from policies associated with Susana Díaz, who gave tacit support to the formation of a minority Partido Popular government in October 2016. Sánchez has consistently refused to support Spain's minority government, and Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy therefore faces new challenges in the Congress. He served as a Deputy in the congress for three terms (for Madrid), and also as Spain's official leader of the opposition from 26 July 2014 to 2016. He was elected as the Secretary-General of the PSOE via a primary election process, and is the first Secretary-General of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party to have been elected directly by its members. After the 2015 elections, the King of Spain, having consulted the parliamentary groups, asked Sánchez to try to form a government on 2 February 2016 but he was unsuccessful and another election was called for June 2016. As a consequence of the PSOE poor showings in the 2016 Basque and Galician elections, 17 members of the PSOE Executive resigned from their posts on 28 September 2016, resulting in the body's dissolution as per party rules and theoretically prompting Sánchez's resignation. Sánchez refused to acknowledge his ouster and remained in his position, with critics responding that Sánchez no longer had "any legitimacy" and urging him to "acknowledge party rules". On 1 October 2016, Pedro Sánchez resigned as PSOE leader after losing a key ballot to Susana Díaz's critics in the party's federal committee held that same day. A few weeks later, on 29 October, he also resigned his seat in Congress after his party's choice to abstain in Mariano Rajoy's investiture and allow a PP minority government. After his resignation and the ensuing abstention of the party in the investiture of Mariano Rajoy, he ran again as a candidate in the primary election to select the Secretary-General in the 39th PSOE Federal Congress, being elected with 50.2 percent of all votes cast on 21 May 2017."

In addition, it is declared Spanish patriot in the republican sense and French Jacobin of the term and monarchical to the extent that the Spanish Monarchy fulfils its duty to symbolise the unity and sovereignty of the Spanish nation."

Herzog has been a member and active member of Union Progreso y Democracia since 2008, when she began to collaborate punctually with the party on legal issues, until in 2011 Rosa Díez signed him definitively, while still working in the prestigious law firm Garrigues. Thus, after the General Elections of 2011 in which UPyD obtained 5 seats and its own Parliamentary Group, it incorporated him as Secretary General in the Congress (a position traditionally occupied by Deputies) as well as legal director in the formation. He is a confessed former voter of both the Popular Party and the Spanish Socialist Workers Party, 8 which in turn are the two main reasons why he ventured to make the leap into politics by the hand of Rosa Díez when it decided to found Union Progreso and Democracy as an alternative to the classic imperfect bipartisanship, traditionally in need of peripheral nationalism, typical of the Spanish political system and which in Herzog's opinion has provoked the imperative need for a radical, centred and reasonable change of Spain that only its formation can offer."
