 landmark_myeongdong_cathedral: "Myeongdong Cathedral"
 landmark_myeongdong_cathedral_desc: "Catholic is only a minority religion in Korea, where atheists make up 60 percent of the population, but Myeongdong Cathedral is nonetheless an landmark that has made the greatest impact on modern Korean history.\n\nKorea in the 20th century was a dictatorship controlled by Junta. However, because they could not send soldiers inside the cathedral for fear of relations with Western countries, so clergy could directly protect pro-democracy activists from the massacres of Korean Junta leaders in the 20th century. Even in the 21st century, Myeongdong Cathedral is still a popular landmark for Seoul's citizen."

 landmark_genbaku_dome: "Genbaku Dome"
 landmark_genbaku_dome_desc: "Genbaku Dome, which can be translated as 'Atomic Bomb Dome' in English, is a landmark symbolizing Hiroshima City. The Genbaku Dome was originally the Hiroshima Prefectural Products Exhibition Hall, designed by Czech architect Jan Letzel in 1915. This building became a highly symbolic landmark following the nuclear attack by the United States in 1945. Although most of the structure was destroyed in the attack, this Dome itself remained standing.\n\nThe historical significance of this dome, which survived despite being at the epicenter of the nuclear attack, remains controversial. Pacifists advocate for making Genbaku dome a symbol of peace, arguing that Japan's overseas aggression led to such a tragic event. On the other hand, nationalists seek to use the Genbaku dome to highlight the brutality of the United States in massacring civilians with nuclear weapons."
