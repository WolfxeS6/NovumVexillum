 VIN_doi_moi_desc: "The decline of the Soviet Union in the late Cold War and China's attempts to reform and open up had a strong impact on Vietnam. Doi Moi licensed private enterprises to Vietnam and distributed farmland to farmers' ownership. These reforms, which partially embraced the capitalism system, allowed the Vietnamese economy to stabilize even after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and allowed the Vietnamese communist system not to collapse."
