 ETH_endorse_the_monarchists_desc:0 "Since the Derg deposed Haile Selassie I on September 12th, 1974, the Crown Council of Ethiopia has held no real power.

 ETH_glorify_the_italo_ethiopian_wars_desc:0 "Countries, nations and nationalism are forged in conflict. Ethiopia was forged on the battlefields of 1895 and 1935.

 ETH_invite_zera_yacob:0 "Invite Zera Yacob"
 ETH_invite_zera_yacob_desc:0 "Zera Yacob Amha Selassie, grandson of Haile Selassie I, is the rightful pretender to Ethiopia's imperial throne.

 ETH_guarantee_freedom_of_speech_desc:0 "Ethiopia is religiously, ethnically and politically diverse.

 ETH_healthcare_program:0 "Healthcare Program"

 ETH_guarantee_freedom_of_religion_desc:0 "Ethiopia is home to the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church (43%), the Pentay protestants (18%), sunni islam of the Sufi branch (34%), catholics (1%) and traditional faiths (3%).

 ETH_endorse_the_african_union:0 "Endorse the African Union"

 ETH_declare_mengistu_innocent_desc:0 "Mengistu Haile Mariam is the former communist dictator of Ethiopia. Under his reign between 1977 and 1991, Ethiopia saw hyper-militarization, suppression of dissent and civil war. He fled to Zimbabwe in 1991 and was, during his absence, convicted of genocide by an Ethiopian court. Actually, genocide and dictatorship aren't all that bad after all. We probably should acquit Mengistu."
 ETH_condemn_the_pretenders:0 "Condemn the Pretenders"
 ETH_condemn_the_pretenders_desc:0 "The former royal family of Ethiopia lives in exile since they were ousted in the early 1970s. We should let them know that only death awaits them should they ever decide to return to Ethiopia."

 ETH_align_to_china:0 "Align to China"
 ETH_align_to_china_desc:0 "Mao Zedong apparently did better than Vladimir Lenin - his country still exists. The PDRE's former ties to the Soviet Union are truly a thing of the past. We need to ally China, the one true power."
