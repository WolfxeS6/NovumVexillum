The military suspended the authority of the existing government and handed over the presidency to Kuomintang with a declaration that it would \"build a new government for the people.\"\nBut this revolution could have been successful by the military, so it's doubtful that the new democratic government will really be a 'democratic' government."

Centrists wanted to lead China into a reformed but stable socialist state, following Deng Xiaoping's guidance. But there are two problems that the Centralists have to solve.

The government sent an army to disperse the protesters, but the situation escalated into a civil war when dispatched soldiers declared they would side with the protesters.\n\nThe current leader of the rebels is Joseph Zen, a liberal Catholic Priest in Hong Kong. It's the military and the peasants who actually have power and although his role is only a symbol, he's passionately saying that he's going to destroy the Communist government of China and bring freedom to China.\n\nFollowing the rebellion in the inland areas, there was also a small rebellion in the maritime areas.

But in reality, they've already given up the whole claim of China. On April 21, 1991, the Taiwanese government officially decided to abolish the §YTemporary Provisions against the Communist Rebellion law§!. It was a law that claimed that the entire mainland of China was occupied by Communist rebels and that the Taiwanese government should get the territory back. And the §Y1992 Consensus§!, which was signed in 1992, allowed the two governments, Taiwan and Beijing, to respect each other and follow one's interpretation of One China, further boosting informal cultural exchanges.\n\nNow, since the 21st century, even the toughest Taiwanese government politicians don't think Taiwan can take over mainland China. Their de facto claim has been completely removed, but the Taiwanese government has not yet officially given up their de jure claim on mainland China. But it is not because the Taiwanese government determines that it will be able to return to mainland China, but because of their internal political problems, represented by §YPan-blue§! and §YPan-green§!. Already, the cultures of Taiwan and the mainland region have become so different that even if they take over mainland China, there is no longer a chance for Taiwan to control mainland China as a core region."

 POLITICS_JIANG_ZEMIN_DESC:0 "Jiang Zemin, the former mayor of Shanghai, received the attention of the Chinese Communist Party by leading the rapid development of Shanghai in the 1980s and effectively preventing liberal protests in Shanghai. After joining the central government, he effectively blocked the publication of newspapers supporting liberal reform during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, gaining the trust of many politicians, and eventually succeeded in becoming China's chairman in 1993.\n\nJiang has already ruled China for a long time since 1993. He succeeded Deng Xiaoping's reform policy, maintaining an economic system that partially combined the communist and capitalist market economies, and leading the country to allow the Chinese economy to grow at a high speed.\n\nBut there are still many problems in China. Coastal cities are developing at a rapid speed, but inland is still poor. Democrats and pro-Westerners still want to destroy the Chinese Communist Party. Now that Jiang's term is not long away, what direction will he lead China?"
 
 POLITICIAN_li_peng_DESC:0 "Li Peng, a Chinese politician and adopted son of PR China's first prime minister, Zhou Enlai, is renowned for his tough policies, which are completely contrary to his moderate adoptive father, Zhou. He entered politics during Deng Xiaoping and began to increase his influence, becoming prime minister like his father in 1988.\n\nIt was a massive anti-government demonstration in Tiananmen in 1989 that made his name known. When the Tiananmen protests in 1989, Li refused all negotiations with the protesters and declared martial law. He was able to gain a stronger influence in Chinese politics by using the military to subdue pro-democracy activists, but he gained the derogatory title of "Butcher of Beijing" from liberals.\n\nHe has opposed Deng Xiaoping's Communist reform policy and confronted the reformist politician Zhu Rongji, but his political influence has diminished as the Chinese Communist Party has decided to accept Deng Xiaoping's reform policy. He had to belatedly decide to agree to Deng Xiaoping's reform policy.\n\nThe news that the "Butcher of Beijing" has returned to Beijing to become China's leader is terrible news for Chinese liberals and Western countries who believe China will implement moderate policies. Li, who has decided to challenge central politics again, will firmly reject any attempt to break up communism, or change moderately."
 
 POLITICIAN_Hu_Jintao_DESC:0 "Hu Jintao, who was trusted by the central government through the separatist crackdown in Tibet, was able to make his name known as Jiang Zemin's most likely successor. He wants to focus on implementing a "Socialist Harmonious Society" policy aimed at addressing poverty and the gap between the rich and the poor in China, while at the same time focusing on growing China's economy."
 
 POLITICIAN_zhang_dejiang_DESC:0 "A former North Korean student who studied economics at Kim Il-sung University, he showed greater activity in local politics than in central politics. He worked in the South Manchurian region to solve the problem of illegal North Korean immigrants and to lead the economic development of the South Manchurian region. Despite Jiang's support and friendly ties with the Shanghai Clique, expectations were not high that he would be able to become China's leader. But because of the intensifying factional conflict within China, he was able to be elected as a 'compromise' for various factions."
 
 POLITICS_PTW_government_DESC:0 "Taiwan's dream of independence has been destroyed. The Chinese government promised Taiwan a 'one country two systems', but the new government in Taiwan is loyal to Beijing's leader, not their citizens."
 
 POLITICS_bo_xilai_DESC:0 "Bo Xilai, the son of Bo Yibo, a former Vice Chairman of China, has gained popularity with the public for his radical policies that are different from other Chinese politicians. Having taken power due to radical political change, he is trying to bring China back to the Maoist period once again. Will his radical political experiment succeed? Or will he lead China to destruction?"
 
 POLITICS_yan_mingfu_DESC:0 "Yan Mingfu, a politician who was sympathetic to protesters during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, lost political power in the government because of his liberal ideals. But his liberal ideals of making China a more liberal country could be realised by the revolution in China. He wants to maintain the Chinese Communist Party system, but reform China into a more free country than before. It is not yet clear whether his limited reform attempts will succeed or lead China to ruin."
 
 POLITICIAN_revolt_chi_haotian_DESC:0 "Chi Haotian was a general who brought troops into Beijing during the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989. He believed that the turmoil in China could be easily overcome using the military, just as it was in 1989. But the protests, initially on a small scale, quickly escalated into a civil war. At the heart of this turmoil is the incompetent existing government. He wants to take control of the existing government and use his strategy to subdue the rebels."
 
 POLITICIAN_revolt_zhao_ziyang_DESC:0 "Zhao Ziyang never forgot the massacre of 1989. When the Tiananmen protests broke out, he moved to save the lives of the students amid government leaders' plans to slaughter them. But his attempts at central politics were thwarted, and other politicians took away all his power.\n\n\"Students, we came too late. We are sorry.\"\n\nAfter his last speech in front of the protesters, he was held under house arrest for decades after the Tiananmen massacre. His hopes for freedom of speech, freedom of thought, and democracy seemed to be lost forever with the students of the slaughtered Tiananmen.\n\nBut in the early 21st century, China once again started a civil war. students in coastal metropolitan areas declared the construction of a democratic China and began to arm themselves. Their numbers are too small, and Beijing's better-armed soldiers are ready to slaughter them. There is de facto no chance that this little democratic country, built during the civil war, will succeed.\n\nNevertheless, Zhao escaped from Beijing, which was confused by the civil war, and arrived in Shanghai as soon as he heard the Democratic Country Declaration. Many university students in Shanghai elected Zhao Ziyang as interim president of China as soon as they heard that he had arrived. Once again, he stood in front of the students with a megaphone. Although it seems certain that this revolution will lead to his death, he can now speak with confidence. He will stand by the students until the last minute. And, This time he's not late."
 
 POLITICIAN_revolt_joseph_zen_DESC:0 "Joseph Zen, the Catholic Bishop of Hong Kong, was never a politician. However, he gained high popularity among the public as he actively fought for democracy and civil liberties in China and Hong Kong, therefore he was elected as the symbolic leader of the rebels when the Chinese civil war broke out.\n\nHe supports the rebels for China's freedom, but he has little political influence. The real power is with the generals who command the rebels, and maybe this will become a new conflict in China after reunification."
 
 POLITICIAN_rev_he_luli_DESC:0 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! 7th June 1934, in Jinan, Shandong, Republic of China\n§YPolitical Career:§! The flame of revolution burned in Beijing, and since 1949, Kuomintang has once again become China's Leader. Can she lead China to the great and prosperous country that Sun Yat-sen dreamed of? The problem is that the political power is not with Kuomintang.\n\nUnlike the Right Kuomintang, which fled to the island of Taiwan after 1949, the Left Kuomintang  remained in mainland China and became PR China's opposition party. Most people who dreamed of becoming politicians in China joined the Communist Party of China, but a former doctor He Luli joined the opposition party Left Kuomintang in 1986.\n\nHaving spent a long career in the Kuomintang Red Cross Society, she has so far been able to engage in very little political activity as an opposition party to the extent allowed by the Communist Party. But after an anti-communist coup broke out and the CPC lost power, she was appointed interim president by coup forces.\n\nShe has now taken on the role of a president, and she want reforming government to become more \"democratic\". But the military refused to grant her much power, and she realised she had one that was not much different from when she was leader of the opposition."
