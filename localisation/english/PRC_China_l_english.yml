 pr_china.4.desc:0 "Right-wing radicalists who want to bring Western democracy into China, and left-wing radicalists who want to return to the era of Maoism in the past, are too dangerous for today's China. Centrists wanted to lead China into a reformed but stable socialist state, following Deng Xiaoping's guidance. But there are two problems that the Centralists have to solve. It's the purge of the left and right-wing in the party, and the destruction of the 'democrats' who want to dismantle the CCP."

 pr_china.5.desc:0 "During the Cold War, China's economy existed as a bloc cut off from the Western world. This changed in part as relations between the United States and China turned friendly, China has still failed to join the WTO. Due to the Jackson–Vanik amendment, which restricts trade with non-liberal countries, the United States did not think positively of boosting trade with China. But with the change of the United States to boost trade with China after the collapse of the Cold War regime, China has an opportunity to join the WTO."

 pr_china.6.desc:0 "The current Communist Party of China has become an excessively totalitarian party. Politicians, including reformists Yan Mingfu and Zhao Ziyang, believe that the Communist Party of China should be reformed to be much more social democratic. But China's reform efforts already failed once in 1989. Even if it is impossible to reform by the public, perhaps with the help of compromisers, reform from the government is possible?"
 pr_china.6.a:0 "Zhongguo Wansui! (Long live China!)"
 
 pr_china.7.t:0 "The Left Opposition"
 pr_china.7.desc:0 "Modern China is no longer a Maoist state. Mao Zedong is respected as the 'father of the state', but his ideology is treated as outdated. But the gap between rich and poor in modern China is getting worse as China abandons its Maoism, which values undeveloped rural areas. Bo Xilai, a radical Maoist, believes that Maoist reform is a way to normalise China again."

But moderates say only the leader of the faction should be removed."

 pr_china.11.t:0 "The Centralist China Reform"
 pr_china.11.desc:0 "The reason for the emergence of radicals and democrats within the party is that the CPC has not yet fully taken control of the country.

We will be able to find helpers who can help the revolution, and with their help, we will be able to establish a new government. But it has to be noted that preparing for a revolution will destabilise our country, therefore the longer the revolutionary preparation period, the darker China's future will be."

 pr_china.22.desc:0 "Zhao Ziyang, and other rightists in the party who tried to reform the CPC 'democratic' are still discriminated against within the party.

Instead, they turned to the Middle East. Of course they won't be looking at the Middle East forever.

One of Tibet's religious leaders, he has been detained for treason since 1995.

The neglect of the problem of peasant poverty has come as a serious crisis, especially in inland areas. Initially, it was only a demonstration to improve the treatment of farmers, but the purpose of the demonstration was extended from peasant welfare to the dissolution of the Communist Party of China. The government sent an army to disperse the protesters, but the situation escalated into a civil war when dispatched soldiers declared they would side with the protesters.\n\nThe current leader of the rebels is Joseph Zen, a liberal Catholic Priest in Hong Kong. It's the military and the peasants who actually have power and although his role is only a symbol, he's passionately saying that he's going to destroy the Communist government of China and bring freedom to China.\n\nFollowing the rebellion in the inland areas, there was also a small rebellion in the maritime areas.  Some extremists are inciting rebellion against communism in large marine cities. Insurrection in big cities is being carried out by young student activists, but their chances of success are de facto none because they has very small supporters."

 PRC_committee:0 "The Central Committee"
 PRC_committee_desc:0 "China has the National People's Congress, but the NPC has no political authority. The Central Committee, which makes political decisions in China, is made up of about 200 members, and you must have their support to govern the country. Without the Central Committee's support, the government will become anxious and your political position will be threatened."
 PRC_ogas_project:0 "The OGAS Project"
 PRC_ogas_project_desc:0 "Fools and conspirators argue that OGAS is an evil artificial intelligence trying to dominate humanity, which will dominate all politics in China and enslave the Chinese. But the truth is, it's not yet possible for humans to build self-conscious artificial intelligence. OGAS is just an 'automated communist economic system through computer networks' conceived in the Soviet Union in the 20th century, and although computers manage all of China's economies, the management of computers is human. [PRC.GetLeader] chose to leave China's economy to computers, not to humans, and we began to invest in the completion of the OGAS program, which the Soviet Union failed to complete. This process is long and will face a lot of resistance. But if we succeed, China's future will have great glory."
 PRC_small_guanxi_effort:0 "Connecting Small Guanxi with Committee members"
 PRC_small_guanxi_effort_desc:0 "Guanxi simply goes beyond the concept of 'relationship' and refers to the deep friendship between the Chinese people. Guanxi is very important in the lives of the Chinese people, and [PRC.GetLeader] will spare no money and passion to form Guanxi with important politicians."

 PRC_foreign_cultural_regulation_desc:0 "Unhealthy movies, games, and cartoons in the West are confusing Chinese values. Let's help Chinese people to have pride in Chinese culture with active cultural regulations."
 PRC_crush_feminist:0 "Feminism Repression"
 PRC_crush_feminist_desc:0 "According to Marxist theory, social discrimination and oppression are imposed by the bourgeois class on the proletarian class. Dealing with the issue of gender discrimination is bourgeois behaviour, and it causes the proletariat to split up and fight with each other. We will regulate the bourgeois movement called feminism spreading in China, and emphasise that women's liberation can only be achieved through the global revolution."
 PRC_approval_feminist:0 "Approval Feminism"
 PRC_approval_feminist_desc:0 "All the way feminism has been regulated by the Chinese Communist Party. Discrimination against women still prevails in modern China, which must be brought down through an active women's liberation movement. The Party will no longer regulate China's feminism."
 PRC_strengthening_national_atheism:0 "Strengthening National Atheism"
 PRC_strengthening_national_atheism_desc:0 "In China, religion is subject to cynicism and contempt. Already, 60 percent of China's population is atheist, and according to Marx's theory, religion is considered opium that corrupts the people. But now there is a threat from the West that threatens atheist China. The Vatican wants to spread Catholicism in China by appointing its bishop. And secret Protestant churches are also spreading throughout China. We must uproot and destroy the foolish Western puppets who believe that the carpenter's son is a god."
 PRC_allow_christian_mission:0 "Allow Christian Mission"
 PRC_allow_christian_mission_desc:0 "Until now, China has actively suppressed Christian beliefs. However, the influence of the Christian faith is limited, and allowing them won't lead to the collapse of the Chinese government. Rather, it may be a better way to allow the Vatican to freely propagate Catholic faith in China and to give religious freedom to Protestant denominations."

PR China had a strong claim to the region from 1949 to 1992, but things changed in 1992. Due to the 1992 agreement between the Republic of China's Straits Exchange Foundation and PR China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, the two countries decided to recognize the §YOne China§! ideology, but freely interpret it. The Chinese government claims One China's "One" is in Beijing, while the Taiwanese government can claim it is in Taipei.\n\nAfter the agreement, exchanges between China and Taiwan began to increase, but there is still a possibility of conflict. PR China still claims the whole of Taiwan as their territory, and there is a possibility of war if the conflict with Taiwan intensifies."

But in reality, they've already given up the whole claim of China. On April 21, 1991, the Taiwanese government officially decided to abolish the §YTemporary Provisions against the Communist Rebellion law§!. It was a law that claimed that the entire mainland of China was occupied by Communist rebels and that the Taiwanese government should get the territory back. And the §Y1992 Consensus§!, which was signed in 1992, allowed the two governments, Taiwan and Beijing, to respect each other and follow one's interpretation of One China, further boosting informal cultural exchanges.\n\nNow, since the 21st century, even the toughest Taiwanese government politicians don't think Taiwan can take over mainland China. Their de facto claim has been completely removed, but the Taiwanese government has not yet officially given up their de jure claim on mainland China. But it is not because the Taiwanese government determines that it will be able to return to mainland China, but because of their internal political problems, represented by §YPan-blue§! and §YPan-green§!. Already, the cultures of Taiwan and the mainland region have become so different that even if they take over mainland China, there is no longer a chance for Taiwan to control mainland China as a core region."

 #chracheter
 POLITICS_JIANG_ZEMIN_DESC:0 "Jiang Zemin, the former mayor of Shanghai, received the attention of the Chinese Communist Party by leading the rapid development of Shanghai in the 1980s and effectively preventing liberal protests in Shanghai. After joining the central government, he effectively blocked the publication of newspapers supporting liberal reform during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, gaining the trust of many politicians, and eventually succeeded in becoming China's chairman in 1993.\n\nJiang has already ruled China for a long time since 1993. He succeeded Deng Xiaoping's reform policy, maintaining an economic system that partially combined the communist and capitalist market economies, and leading the country to allow the Chinese economy to grow at a high speed.\n\nBut there are still many problems in China. Coastal cities are developing at a rapid speed, but inland is still poor. Democrats and pro-Westerners still want to destroy the Chinese Communist Party. Now that Jiang's term is not long away, what direction will he lead China?"
 
 POLITICIAN_li_peng_DESC:0 "Li Peng, a Chinese politician and adopted son of PR China's first prime minister, Zhou Enlai, is renowned for his tough policies, which are completely contrary to his moderate adoptive father, Zhou. He entered politics during Deng Xiaoping and began to increase his influence, becoming prime minister like his father in 1988.\n\nIt was a massive anti-government demonstration in Tiananmen in 1989 that made his name known. When the Tiananmen protests in 1989, Li refused all negotiations with the protesters and declared martial law. He was able to gain a stronger influence in Chinese politics by using the military to subdue pro-democracy activists, but he gained the derogatory title of "Butcher of Beijing" from liberals.\n\nHe has opposed Deng Xiaoping's Communist reform policy and confronted the reformist politician Zhu Rongji, but his political influence has diminished as the Chinese Communist Party has decided to accept Deng Xiaoping's reform policy. He had to belatedly decide to agree to Deng Xiaoping's reform policy.\n\nThe news that the "Butcher of Beijing" has returned to Beijing to become China's leader is terrible news for Chinese liberals and Western countries who believe China will implement moderate policies. Li, who has decided to challenge central politics again, will firmly reject any attempt to break up communism, or change moderately."
 
 POLITICIAN_Hu_Jintao_DESC:0 "Hu Jintao, who was trusted by the central government through the separatist crackdown in Tibet, was able to make his name known as Jiang Zemin's most likely successor. He wants to focus on implementing a "Socialist Harmonious Society" policy aimed at addressing poverty and the gap between the rich and the poor in China, while at the same time focusing on growing China's economy."
 
 POLITICIAN_zhang_dejiang_DESC:0 "A former North Korean student who studied economics at Kim Il-sung University, he showed greater activity in local politics than in central politics. He worked in the South Manchurian region to solve the problem of illegal North Korean immigrants and to lead the economic development of the South Manchurian region. Despite Jiang's support and friendly ties with the Shanghai Clique, expectations were not high that he would be able to become China's leader. But because of the intensifying factional conflict within China, he was able to be elected as a 'compromise' for various factions."
 
 POLITICS_PTW_government_DESC:0 "Taiwan's dream of independence has been destroyed. The Chinese government promised Taiwan a 'one country two systems', but the new government in Taiwan is loyal to Beijing's leader, not their citizens."
 
 POLITICS_bo_xilai_DESC:0 "Bo Xilai, the son of Bo Yibo, a former Vice Chairman of China, has gained popularity with the public for his radical policies that are different from other Chinese politicians. Having taken power due to radical political change, he is trying to bring China back to the Maoist period once again. Will his radical political experiment succeed? Or will he lead China to destruction?"
 
 POLITICS_yan_mingfu_DESC:0 "Yan Mingfu, a politician who was sympathetic to protesters during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, lost political power in the government because of his liberal ideals. But his liberal ideals of making China a more liberal country could be realised by the revolution in China. He wants to maintain the Chinese Communist Party system, but reform China into a more free country than before. It is not yet clear whether his limited reform attempts will succeed or lead China to ruin."
 
 POLITICIAN_revolt_chi_haotian_DESC:0 "Chi Haotian was a general who brought troops into Beijing during the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989. He believed that the turmoil in China could be easily overcome using the military, just as it was in 1989. But the protests, initially on a small scale, quickly escalated into a civil war. At the heart of this turmoil is the incompetent existing government. He wants to take control of the existing government and use his strategy to subdue the rebels."
 
 POLITICIAN_revolt_zhao_ziyang_DESC:0 "Zhao Ziyang never forgot the massacre of 1989. When the Tiananmen protests broke out, he moved to save the lives of the students amid government leaders' plans to slaughter them. But his attempts at central politics were thwarted, and other politicians took away all his power.\n\n\"Students, we came too late. We are sorry.\"\n\nAfter his last speech in front of the protesters, he was held under house arrest for decades after the Tiananmen massacre. His hopes for freedom of speech, freedom of thought, and democracy seemed to be lost forever with the students of the slaughtered Tiananmen.\n\nBut in the early 21st century, China once again started a civil war. students in coastal metropolitan areas declared the construction of a democratic China and began to arm themselves. Their numbers are too small, and Beijing's better-armed soldiers are ready to slaughter them. There is de facto no chance that this little democratic country, built during the civil war, will succeed.\n\nNevertheless, Zhao escaped from Beijing, which was confused by the civil war, and arrived in Shanghai as soon as he heard the Democratic Country Declaration. Many university students in Shanghai elected Zhao Ziyang as interim president of China as soon as they heard that he had arrived. Once again, he stood in front of the students with a megaphone. Although it seems certain that this revolution will lead to his death, he can now speak with confidence. He will stand by the students until the last minute. And, This time he's not late."
 
 POLITICIAN_revolt_joseph_zen_DESC:0 "Joseph Zen, the Catholic Bishop of Hong Kong, was never a politician. However, he gained high popularity among the public as he actively fought for democracy and civil liberties in China and Hong Kong, therefore he was elected as the symbolic leader of the rebels when the Chinese civil war broke out.\n\nHe supports the rebels for China's freedom, but he has little political influence. The real power is with the generals who command the rebels, and maybe this will become a new conflict in China after reunification."
