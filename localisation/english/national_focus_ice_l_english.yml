 #Invest in the Fishing Industry
 ICE_invest_in_the_fishing_industry:0 "Invest in the Fishing Industry"
 ICE_invest_in_the_fishing_industry_desc:0 "The so-called "ocean cluster", which includes all economic sectors related to fishery, is Iceland's most important economic source of income. Just short of 30% of Iceland's entire GDP comes from this ocean cluster. If Iceland is to persist, we need to create jobs and investing in the fishing industry is the right way to do so."
 ICE_make_concessions_to_britain:0 "Make Concessions to Britain"
 ICE_make_concessions_to_britain_desc:0 "Iceland's largest adversary during the Cold War was not the USSR, but the UK. In the "Cod Wars", Icelandic coast guard ships attempted to stop fishing trawlers, mainly British, from overfishing parts of the Atlantic close to Icelandic territory. Iceland extended its 3 nautical miles of exclusive economic area (1952) all the way to 200 nautical miles (1976). Perhaps a few reforms are in order to appease the UK."
 ICE_develop_reykjavik_suburbs:0 "Develop Reykjavik Suburbs"
 ICE_develop_reykjavik_suburbs_desc:0 "Reykjavik is the only major settlement on Iceland, at over 110,000 inhabitants. Living quarters and industrial facilities can only be realistically sustained in Reykjavik. For now, at least."
 ICE_industrial_investments:0 "Industrial Investments"
 ICE_industrial_investments_desc:0 "If we are to be able to expand our industrial facilities to the rest of the island, we will need major investments for our factories and businesses."
 ICE_fund_the_university_of_reykjavik:0 "Fund the University of Reykjavik"

 ICE_develop_the_cement_industry:0 "Develop the Cement Industry"
 ICE_develop_the_cement_industry_desc:0 "Iceland does not hold any significant natural resources besides aluminium. If we do not innovate, we will perish. Strengthening our cement industry will allow us to build new houses and factories around the country."
 ICE_fund_holar_university_college:0 "Fund Hólar University College"
 ICE_fund_holar_university_college_desc:0 "We should continue the funding of our higher education."
 ICE_additional_equipment_for_reykjavik_harbor:0 "Additional Equipment for Reykjavik Harbor"

 ICE_invest_in_the_aluminium_industry:0 "Invest in the Aluminium Industry"
 ICE_invest_in_the_aluminium_industry_desc:0 "Aluminium goods mark nearly 40% of Icelandic exports, putting the metal even ahead of seafood as Iceland's most popular trade goods on the world market. Aluminium is the only natural resource that the Icelandic mainland has in abundance, and we should try to exploit our minerals as best as we can."
 ICE_further_aluminium_investments:0 "Further Aluminium Investments"
 ICE_further_aluminium_investments_desc:0 "Although power-intensive, the aluminium industry has provided Iceland with a stable income. Iceland currently stands at 11th among the world's aluminium producers and we should not allow our potential in this industry to go to waste. Creating further employment opportunities in our aluminium smelting facilities is the logical thing to do."
 ICE_affirm_the_status_quo:0 "Affirm the Status Quo"
 ICE_affirm_the_status_quo_desc:0 "Us Icelanders are a peaceful people. Our island is out of the way, and we don't have any enemies, so what reason do we have to militarise our island? We should go with the flow."
 ICE_bolster_the_coast_guard:0 "Bolster the Coast Guard"
 ICE_bolster_the_coast_guard_desc:0 "While we don't have any enemies, we should still be prudent with our safety. A good way to do this is by improving our coast guard."
 ICE_defensive_emergency_plans:0 "Defensive Emergency Plans"
 ICE_defensive_emergency_plans_desc:0 "We should also be prepared for an absolute worst case scenario. We wouldn't want to get caught off guard."
 ICE_construct_additional_motorways:0 "Construct Additional Motorways"
 ICE_construct_additional_motorways_desc:0 "Being able to quickly and efficiently traverse the island is paramount in everything from military defence, to exportation!"
 ICE_approach_the_eu:0 "Approach the EU"
 ICE_approach_the_eu_desc:0 "Iceland has been part of the European Economic Area for quite some time. Full European Union membership could hold economic benefits - even though we would lose certain autonomies."
 ICE_maintain_economic_distance:0 "Maintain Economic Distance"
 ICE_maintain_economic_distance_desc:0 "While some aspects of the EU are certainly tempting, it would most certainly be better to keep our distance and remain a part of the EEA."
 ICE_invite_european_scientists:0 "Invite European Scientists"
 ICE_invite_european_scientists_desc:0 "We could always bolster our research and development sector by enticing scientists to move here..."
 ICE_further_economic_growth:0 "Further Economic Growth"

 ICE_the_militarization_of_iceland:0 "The Militarization of Iceland"
 ICE_the_militarization_of_iceland_desc:0 "Iceland sits directly in the middle of the GIUK Gap, a strategic chokepoint that plenty of strong nations have their eye on. We cannot be caught unprepared for any conflict that may happen."
 ICE_reassure_nato:0 "Reassure NATO"
 ICE_reassure_nato_desc:0 "Although Iceland is choosing a more active military role, we will inform NATO that that does not mean we intend to ditch the alliance."

 ICE_create_the_icelandic_army:0 "Create the Icelandic Army"

 ICE_create_the_icelandic_navy:0 "Create the Icelandic Navy"
 ICE_create_the_icelandic_navy_desc:0 "A coast guard will do us no good in the event of an actual war. We need a navy."
 ICE_create_the_icelandic_air_force:0 "Create the Icelandic Air Force"
 ICE_create_the_icelandic_air_force_desc:0 "We cannot rely on other nations to police our air for long, we must be self-sufficient."
 ICE_icelandic_panzer_forces:0 "Icelandic Armored Forces"
 ICE_icelandic_panzer_forces_desc:0 "Researching and developing our own tanks could prove to be immensely advantageous in the event of a conflict.
 ICE_fortress_iceland:0 "Fortress Iceland"
 ICE_fortress_iceland_desc:0 "We have the major defensive advantage of being an island in the freezing waters of the north, but that is not enough. We need to ensure we have defences beyond that."

 ICE_propose_an_alliance_to_sweden:0 "Propose an Alliance to Sweden"
 ICE_propose_an_alliance_to_sweden_desc:0 "Now that Iceland has chosen NATO to be unworthy, we need to perhaps consider an alliance of smaller scale with other countries that have so far elected to stay neutral. Sweden would be a formidable pick for our next big ally."
 ICE_befriend_russia:0 "Befriend Russia"
 ICE_befriend_russia_desc:0 "Now that we are taking distance from the United States and her allies, we should draw closer to America's adversaries to assure our position in this new world."
 ICE_north_sea_interests:0 "North Sea Interests"
 ICE_north_sea_interests_desc:0 "We need to be the dominant nation in the North Sea, and we cannot be subservient to the British swine."
 ICE_invite_finland:0 "Invite Finland"
 ICE_invite_finland_desc:0 "Strengthening the Swedish-Icelandic alliance can only be done by involving more formerly neutral states. Finland is a great pick."
 ICE_befriend_china:0 "Befriend China"
 ICE_befriend_china_desc:0 "Far away and following a secret agenda of its own, China is a great and mysterious force to be reckoned with. However, its economic influence is rapidly increasing, and good relations with China might be a finite cake - and we need to get a slice of said cake."
 ICE_militarize_the_coast_guard:0 "Militarise the Coast Guard"
 ICE_militarize_the_coast_guard_desc:0 "Militarising the coast guard is a great way to increase the security for our island!"

 ICE_icelandic_warship_production:0 "Icelandic Warship Production"
 ICE_icelandic_warship_production_desc:0 "Militarising the coast guard was a good first step in improving our navy, but it is not the last. We need to produce actual warships. We ARE an island, afterall."
 ICE_demand_greenlandic_independence:0 "Demand Greenlandic Independence"
 ICE_demand_greenlandic_independence_desc:0 "The biggest tragedy of the North Sea is that Denmark still maintains sovereignty over Greenland. We need to push them over the edge and force them to allow Greenland to leave."
 ICE_nordic_cooperation_programs:0 "Nordic Cooperation Programs"
 ICE_nordic_cooperation_programs_desc:0 "Iceland is not a major player on the world stage. We have chosen to stay out of faraway conflicts and have instead decided to focus on countries that are close to us both geographically and diplomatically."
 ICE_befriend_norway:0 "Befriend Norway"
 ICE_befriend_norway_desc:0 "Norway ships to us a tenth of Iceland's imports. A conflict with Norway would mean immediate economic backlash and disaster. We need to keep Norway loyal and on friendly terms."
 ICE_befriend_sweden:0 "Befriend Sweden"
 ICE_befriend_sweden_desc:0 "Iceland and Sweden are a pair of good friends. We are common members of the European common markets, of the NB8, the Nordic Council, the Council of Europe, the Arctic Council and other organisations. We need to stay close to the Swedes."
 ICE_befriend_finland:0 "Befriend Finland"
 ICE_befriend_finland_desc:0 "Although relatively far away, Finland is a good and reliable European partner. We should bolster our common economic relationship."
 ICE_befriend_denmark:0 "Befriend Denmark"

 ICE_befriend_the_baltic_states:0 "Befriend the Baltic States"
 ICE_befriend_the_baltic_states_desc:0 "Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania traditionally attempt to stay close to the Nordic Countries. We should welcome their approach with open arms."
 ICE_befriend_france:0 "Befriend France"
 ICE_befriend_france_desc:0 "France is a great potential market that the Icelandic importers and exporters are not yet tapping to the greatest of possibilities. We need to encourage a mutual expansion of markets."
 ICE_befriend_germany:0 "Befriend Germany"
 ICE_befriend_germany_desc:0 "Germany is Iceland's second most important origin of imports and fourth most important destination of exports. The Germans are the perhaps most politically influential force in western and central Europe and have a formidable diplomatic outreach. Having them as Iceland's friend would be a good idea."
 ICE_befriend_the_netherlands:0 "Befriend the Netherlands"
 ICE_befriend_the_netherlands_desc:0 "The Netherlands is far more vital to Iceland than might appear at first glance. Most of Iceland's exports to the European continent have to go through the port of Rotterdam, making the Netherlands Iceland's most important export destination at over a quarter of all exported goods, which puts them well ahead of the UK, Spain, Germany and France, the next most important partners."
