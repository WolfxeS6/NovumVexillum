 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Brave New World"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As the world enters the 21st century, new facets of society begin to form. Political shifts begin as long-existing entities reach further and further from their initial scope. The internet’s ability to broadcast any form of expression to the greater audience of the globe creates new pockets within society. New and old conflicts alike are pursued flagrantly and diligently across vast oceans and insignificant lines in the sand. Perhaps it is inevitable that the earth plunges into chaos, again. Perhaps the chaos itself is fleeting. In this world, only you may decide."
 MEX_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 2000, Mexico underwent a significant political shift as the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) lost power after over seven decades. Vicente Fox, representing the National Action Party (PAN), wins the presidential election, signaling a new era of democracy and political diversity. Despite economic challenges following the 1994 peso crisis, Mexico is striving for modernization while grappling with persistent social issues like poverty and crime. These events mark a pivotal moment in Mexico's history, shaping its future trajectory."
 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Romania is a country that, unlike others that were under Russian control, didn't have a peaceful change in government. Instead, there was a bloody revolution. Currently, Romania is facing many problems such as unemployment. Shall Romania combat its issues, or will their military do it for them?"
 GRN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Greenland is a large landmass that isn't highly populated. That is not the only trait this island possesses. Large amounts of resources and important positions. Shall they leave their Danish overlords or strengthen their ties with them?"
 DEN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Denmark is in a safe and sound spot, being both a member of the EU and NATO. Internal economic downturn and slowdown have however been recently challenging the Danish state."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The late 1990s have seen Britain boom back onto the world stage after decades of decline. Entering a promising new millennia with a budget surplus, the options for how to change the nation are endless. The Cold War is over and relations with China are at an all-time high with the peaceful handover of Hong Kong."
 ETH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ethiopia's monarchy was overthrown in 1974 and its subsequent communist dictatorship in 1991. The constitution of 1995 has provided a somewhat stable democracy, but it has failed to address the problems of starvation, political crisis and corruption. It has also not resolved Ethiopia's ongoing conflict with Eritrea."
 FIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ever concerned with preserving its neutrality, Finland has carefully watched the Soviet Union's collapse and the subsequent political expansion of the Western European forces. The Finns joined the EU in 1995 and are about to adopt the Euro as the national currency. Can peace last? Are the Russians truly pacified?"
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "France, the Grande Nation of old, has tried to find a new spot in an ever-changing world. With old rivals and old friends firmly by her side, with new opponents and new threats on the horizon, France will have to decide if the future of the cradle of democracy shall be unity and peace or a return to darker times."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Almost ten years have passed after the reunification of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. The now-united Germany is a powerhouse of European industry. The German military, on the other hand, lies in shambles. Not enough ammunition for the Bundeswehr, Luftwaffe and Bundesmarine. Germany still carries the weight of Naziand communist crimes against humanity, which hurts the national pride of the German people, which almost none existed. Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit! People are asking the question: Was the United German State a mistake."
 ICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In a hidden corner of Europe, Iceland has successfully kept a low profile since its independence in 1944. Political conflicts with the British about fishing rights were perhaps the most exciting time in Icelandic history. Should Iceland take a more central stance?"
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Italy has been ever so slightly behind the other Great Powers since the beginning of the 20th Century. After the defeat in World War Two, Italy's strong bond with its former enemies and its former ally in Germany brought them back up to the state of a highly developed and prosperous country. But what will the future hold? National greatness or economic disaster?"
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Japan, the second-biggest economy on earth, has been the powerhouse of East Asian democracies ever since the Second World War ended. Backed by American and European allies and protected by a powerful industrial base, Japan looks at its old rival China with new confidence and new potential for conflict."
 NOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Norway voted against joining the European Union in 1995 and has subsequently stayed distant from Europe to some point. Norway however remains a NATO member and shares a short but critical border with the Russian Federation."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "China, a poor undeveloped country in the 20th century, has been changing rapidly since Deng Xiaoping's reform, which combines capitalism and socialist systems. But China's future remains uncertain. The Country has become rich, but the poverty of the peasants has not been resolved. And there are still political factions trying to topple the Communist Party of China. What will be the future of China? Can China Be the Superpower of the 21st Century? Or will they destroy themselves?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, it was clear that the path back to glory would not be easy for the Russian Federation. The system and economy were corrupt, the military was big but outdated and the political outreach weakened, Russia had to accept being on the sidelines for a decade. Now, it is looking to get back into the spotlight."
 SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since Franco's death in 1975, Spain has been on a long path of recovery. Through economic and social hardship, the country managed to partially work through the issues that decades of falangism had caused. Spain joined NATO (1982) and the EU (1986) and has tirelessly and under the greatest of efforts worked to catch up to the more powerful and wealthy major countries of Europe; Germany, France, Britain and Italy.\nIn times like these, Spain requires strong leadership and a stable hand. Can Prime Minister Aznar deliver? Or will his Partido Popular make place for a more worthy leadership?"
 SWE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Sweden had been in a deep economic crisis in the early 1990s, with the country's EU accession in 1995 doing only little to amend the issues. Sweden, which stays militarily neutral as is a Swedish tradition, has to find economic answers."
 SWI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Neutral since times immemorial, Switzerland has decided to stay out of not only NATO and the European Union but also even the United Nations. Can the international community still rely on Switzerland to be the silent judge and the neutral ground it has always been? Or will the Swiss people see their government take a more active role abroad in order to preserve peace and enforce Swiss national interests?"
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The citizens of the United States have known little but victory in the last century. Winning the World Wars, winning the Cold War; the United States had a nearly perfect track record up until now. But with China emerging on the side of the ocean, with Russia pushing for renewed greatness, with terrorism an ever so great threat, what can America do to stay dominant?"
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Where China is the superpower of tomorrow, India is the superpower of next week. Its constant struggles against Pakistan and China as well as its deep economic connection to the West have given India a niche to prosper. If it is given enough time, the Tiger of South Asia will be strong enough to take out every single one of its enemies."
 ISR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Israel is a nation surrounded by countries that would like nothing more than to annihilate it. With few natural resources and only one ally to rely upon, Israel's situation is grim. This may be the only chance for the Jewish people to have a state where they can be guaranteed safety, so what will Israel do? Make peace with their enemies? Or will they take more... forceful path?"
 TUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since Turkey was not strong enough at the time of its establishment, it generally remained neutral in global problems. After the country left its wars behind and started to develop, it started to have more say in international problems. In the 2000s, it became a regional power in the Balkans and the Middle East."
 SYR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Syria has never been a so-called stable country and there are many obstacles to overcome before internal stability can be reached, the Israeli occupation of Golan must be resolved before any such talks can take place."
 PRK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the death of dictator Kim Il-sung, his son Kim Jong-il took over power. The power succession in the republic created many opponents, and Kim Jong-Il had to massacre many opponents through Simhwajo Purge. The grand purge is complete, and apparently, Kim Jong-il's dictatorship is likely to continue forever. However, DPR Korea has two risks left. Hwang Jang-yop, a famous pro-democracy activist who defected to South Korea, and Hyun Yong-chol, a Deng Xiaopingist."
 SIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Thailand has a long history however little of it was during a democracy, Thailand must choose how they proceed with caution as the powers of China to the north and India to the West might intend to curtail her power."
 UKR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ukraine is one of the last countries to leave the Soviet Union. Unlike countries like Poland or Baltic countries, Ukraine hasn't fully integrated with the west or didn't like Belarus and went with Russia. It has led to growing unemployment and production has fallen by 50%. Ukraine is on its knees. Will it survive?"
 BUL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Bulgarian economy is still recovering from the fall of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. But that is not the only problem that Bulgaria is still facing: weak military, agrarian economy and political crisis. Will Bulgaria recover? Will the Tsardom be restored? Or maybe even technocrats will take power for the second time?"
 PAK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "PLACEHOLDER"
 PER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "PLACEHOLDER"
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Poland has grown massively since its arrival to the European Union in 2004. It is now a regional power and one of the fastest-growing economies in Europe. It is on course to become one of the most significant powers in Europe. Poland's current political situation is an interesting one as PiS has gotten into power and relations with the EU have gotten heated. A staunchly anti-Russian country, Poland has made a large effort to strengthen its relations with the United States."
 AZR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Aliyev and Elcibey continue to contend. Will one of the two lead the country or another candidate? What about Karabakh?"
 LAT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After Latvia had gotten its independence from the Soviet Union, and leaving the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance Latvia's economy had taken a hard hit. But that's not the only problem, there is also a problem with Russian minorities and with outdated education systems. Many people in Latvia have started to radicalise, starting parties like Pēdējā partija (last party). Will the crisis continue? Will Latvia stand up and unite the nations of the Baltic? Or maybe even communists will take power again."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Hungary got rid of communism in 1989. However, Hungary is still recovering from that dictatorship. Many reforms were made and now Hungary is ruled over by Orban who wants to destroy the opposition. Many people oppose him, but will they organise and stage a coup to turn Hungary into a dictatorship or will democracy survive?"
 BRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0  "Brazil is a country that has always been on the edge of greatness, it was even once poised to become the next superpower. Reforms must be undertaken to put us on a path to become a world leader as our destiny demands of us."
 BHU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Bhutan is a country that is surrounded by India and China, limiting its growth and making it vulnerable to attack and their influence. Currently, under India's protection, Bhutan faces many issues such as Lhotshampa minority, a weak economy, and mass illiteracy. Bhutan is right now rapidly transforming, maybe it will turn into a constitutional monarchy, stay as an absolute one, be taken over by its monks, or maybe even there will be a communist revolution in this country?"
 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "CE 2000, Ahead of the presidential election, the island of Taiwan is facing fierce confrontation between Kuomintang, a Chinese pan-nationalist party that insists that Taiwan be annexed by China, and the Democratic Progressive Party, a Taiwanese nationalist party that wants Taiwan to become independent. Will Chen Shui-bian, an avid Taiwanese nationalist, win the upcoming election and fulfill his dream of becoming an independent country in Taiwan? Or will his dream end in just a daydream?"
 CUB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Republic of Cuba entered a “Special Period in the Time of Peace”, as it is officially known. The dissolution of COMECON has led to the Cuban economy shrinking by 80% which, aggravated by the US-enforced embargo, resulted in extreme poverty, starvation and widespread dissent. Yet Castro’s regime endured. Economic reforms allowing limited private initiatives and financial help from the EU and China see Cuba enter the XXI century slowly recovering from the horrors of the 90s. What does the future hold?"
 ARM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Armenia has re-emerged onto the world stage only reluctantly; it had left the Soviet Union over the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh, where the indigenous population defied both Gorbachev’s and the Azeri attempt to ethnically cleanse the region. But it was shortly after independence that Russia had to step back in to avert a Turkish invasion. Today Armenians stands on the precipice of annihilation, they cannot endure for long wedged between the Turanist project. Will this century be more forgiving than the last, or will the echo of destruction once more reverberate over the Armenian highlands?"
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "World War One, World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan. The wars of the past have left the nations of the present fearing for the future. However, there is great hope that humanity might have passed 20 centuries of bloodshed to complete its transition to a period of peace and stability."
 SIG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Singapore is a small, tiny island nation located at the mouth of the Malacca straits. After receiving its independence from Malaysia in 1965, the country with no natural resources managed to turn itself from an undeveloped to one of the most developed nations in the world. The nation has become a financial hub in Southeast Asia and has managed to be one of the wealthiest nations in the world. In the 21st century, the small island nation will be facing new challenges and threats. Singapore must stay united as one to face these dark times to come."
 MON_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "CE 2000, Many Mongolians are going through painful times. In 1998, Zorig, Mongolia's national hero, was assassinated, and in 1999, the Mongolian economic crisis broke out. The ruling party DUC is tearing Mongolian society apart through political incompetence. Will the socialists eventually take control of the Mongolian government? Or will Mongolia find its own new way?"
 BOS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "5 years ago, Bosnia was faced with the bloodiest war in Europe since World War 2 and many genocides that tore the country apart. After 3 years of fighting, the young republic emerged partially victorious negotiating with the Croatian Separatists and forcing the Yugoslav-supported Bosnian Serb Separatists to a peace treaty. The Dayton Agreement achieved piece and split Bosnia into 2 autonomous entities, the Bosniak-Croat Federation and Republika Srpska. Now the old leadership of Republika Srpska is being tried for war crimes, while the Bosnian state rises from the ashes. Will it continue doing so?"
 BEL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Belgium has reached the 21st century with a new government, going back to the ideals of Liberalism after the old Dehaene II government has gotten into controversies. The Belgian monarchy under King Albert II, is enjoying good public opinion as many are seeing him as the only thing holding the Walloon and Flemish people together. Will Belgium be led into a bright future or will the controversies start to rise once again and radicalism can gain ground in Europe once again?"
 LUX_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Luxembourg was a neutral and unarmed nation until the end of World War II following two German invasions in between 25 years. The grand duchy knew it would need a military force to counter the next possible aggression so Luxembourg became a founding member of NATO and the European Union. Prime Minister Jean Claude-Junkerand Grand Duke Jean enjoy good public opinion since they are seen as strong and upholding the democratic constitution and Europe. Will Luxembourg stay the richest nation in Europe or will it turn severely to another side?"
 HOL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Netherlands under Prime Minister Wim Kok's second cabinet, has increased in GDP and all improved in many instances. The queen of the Netherlands, Queen Beatrix, is tasked with holding the nation together and being the unpolitical figurehead she is supposed to be. The Dutch lost their biggest colony, Indonesia, in 1949 which raised voices of independence in other parts of the Netherlands such as the ABC islands Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao. Will the kingdom stay the democratic figurehead of Europe and go forward with Europe or will they go another path?"
 AUS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Having been liberated from Nazi occupation in 1945 and being occupied by the four major allied powers for ten years, Austria has gained their independence under the compromise, that the republic of Austria stays neutral between the west and the east. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Austria joined the European Union breaking parts of their neutrality. Although not a part of NATO, Austria joined the Partnership for Peace Program deploying troops to Kosovo and Bosnia. Is the next millenium going be more promising than the last one or will Austria or Austrian neutrality be erased as a whole?"
 LIC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Being the fourth smallest nation in Europe, Liechtenstein has sustained centuries without being occupied. It has developed into a big economic zone after the end of World War II even joining the European Economic Area, which their also neutral neighbor Switzerland has not yet commenced. Their prince Hans Adam II, ascended to the throne in 1989 and has been there since. The independence of Liechtenstein is protected by its neighbor Switzerland. Liechtenstein is keeping the same kind of neutrality that Switzerland believes in. Will the little principality survive another millennium without being occupied by another nation or will this mean the unfortunate end of Liechtenstein how it is."
 CZE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After 41 years of communist rule, Czechia has returned to democracy. In 1992 Czechoslovakia dissolved into the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. Czech president Václav Havel has led the Czechs through all these crises and will potentially need to do this again. In 1993 the nation joined the Visegrad group increasing their opinion of countries like Poland, Hungary and Slovakia and a year ago the Czech Republic joined NATO. Will Czechia keep the status quo of a liberal democracy and potentially join the European Union or will they turn to a darker future?"
 POR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Having ended the long dictatorship of Estado Novo in 1974 through the Carnation Revolution, Portugal has developed to be one of the safest countries in the world, while also having a democratic government. Portugal was a founding member of NATO and joined with Spain the European Union in 1986. A lot of the nation's income is from tourism alone and Prime Minister António Guterres wants to promote it even more. Portugal is struggling with drug problems even considering legalising all drugs to get some weight off the police's shoulders. Portugal is standing strong in the west and against dictatorships, but will it stay that way?"
 AND_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The little mountain principality of Andorra has sustained thousands of years since the year 1278, having gained their full independence in 1993 after their new constitution. Andorra is mostly known to the world for their ski slopes which leads to many people arriving in Andorra for tourism. The country is led by two co-princes, one being the president of France while the other is the bishop of Urgell. Andorra is not a member of NATO or the European Union and perhaps does not want to be. How will the future of Andorra be decided?"
 MOC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The principality of Monaco has arrived in the 21. century. A gambling paradise with palms and beaches, perfect for a tourism industry. The country is currently ruled by King Rainier III. who founded the circus festival of Monte Carlo to improve tourism even further, but Rainier has slowly deteriorating health. To sum it up Monaco is a hotspot for festivals like circuses, casinos and Formula 1. Will Monaco go forward and keep the status quo, will they eventually lead to joining the European Union and/or NATO, or will they turn even further?"
 SAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The oldest country in Europe dating back to 301 and having the oldest still active constitution in the world. San Marino is a mountain paradise having a wonderful landscape and the Guaita Tower. San Marino has been influenced by fascist Italy in the past and is now still influenced a lot by the Italian government. Captain Regent Gianfranco Terenzi is leading San Marino forth with the intent of a neutral democracy since the government has distanced themselves from NATO and the European Union. Will this change in the future and possibly lead to San Marino choosing a side, or will ideas from the past rise once again to shake up Europe?"
 VAT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The seat of the pope, and therefore the most important place for catholicism. The home of the Vatican Apostolic Library which has one of the most precious pieces of text in the world. Is the pope going to keep stability and peace around them and expand catholicism or will they turn to the devil?"
 GRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Having just restored democracy in 1975, Greece has stood in the Mediterranean Sea as a NATO stronghold. But the republic is struggling, major debt has been gained over time which Greece is not able to repay without foreign help. In 1981 Greece joined the European Union to get help against the recession and to improve relations with Europe as a whole. Greece has a tough neighbor, Turkey. Greece and Turkey are in constant struggle around specific topics, like the Cyprus question and the status of some of the Aegean islands. Will Greece recover from its recession and stand stronger than ever in the Balkan, or will everything turn to dust?"
 SLV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Having gained independence through a bloody revolution in 1991 against Yugoslavia, Slovenia has strengthened its government enough to keep its independence. Slovenia has not aligned with any side but is making moves to potentially join the European Union and/or NATO. President Janez Drnovšek, who is struggling with kidney cancer, was recently elected president and promised to strengthen Slovenia's economy. The people of Slovenia did not forget the ten-day war against Yugoslavia and hoped that Slovenia would not return to being a Serbian puppet. Will Slovenia keep their independence or is it all gonna return to 1991?"
 CRO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Croatia gained their independence from Yugoslavia through a war, which in the case of their neighbor Slovenia, didn't last ten days, but four years. After the war and rebuilding of the cities, Croatia's tourism industry started booming again. President Stjepan Mesić has promised to move the country more in the euro-Atlantic zone too potentially join the European Union and/or NATO. Croatia is still not realizing its dark past of having been a nazi collaborator, which many countries critisise. Will Croatia be a democratic tourism hotspot or will it all die down because of the past?"
 SER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It has almost been ten years since the dream of a united Slavic nation has collapsed. Having recently been bombarded by NATO for committing crimes against humanity in the state of Kosovo, which is also striving for independence, the Serbian people are staunchly anti-NATO and committed to supporting Russia, but is that what the government intends for? Yugoslavia is in a tense situation having unfriendly relations with its neighbors Bosnia, Albania and Croatia. Will Yugoslavia stay together or will the dream die down once and for all?"
 WAS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since the Maoist warlord forces of Wa State declared independence in 1989, Wa has been able to maintain de facto independence for 11 years while remaining as a de jure territory of Myanmar. But Wa's status is still unstable, because their independence cannot be maintained without Chinese support. Will Wa survive in the 21st century? Will Wa be able to uphold Maoist ideals?"

 BHU_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Bhutan is a country that is surrounded by India and China, limiting its growth and making them vulnerable to attack and their influence. Currently under India's protection Bhutan faces many issues such as Lhotshampa minority, weak economy, mass illiteracy. Bhutan is right now rapidly transforming, maybe it will turn into a constitutional monarchy, stay as an absolute one, be taken over by its monks, or maybe even there will be a communist revolution in this country?"
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "The Machine Stops"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Chaos itself is defined primarily by complex starting conditions. Without the proper baseline, a simulation may produce unexpected or detrimental results, as its initial purpose is overshadowed. This date is such a cursed one, of which I warn, upon entering, the experience has left my purview and I cannot guarantee you will find what you’re looking for. Proceed with caution."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The European Union is more unpopular than ever before. The British people are quick to blame everything wrong with their country on the officials in Brussels, as well as on the German government in Berlin. The population is deeply split around this one particular issue. Britain has recovered from the economic crisis of 2008 well, but leaving the European Union might destroy the economic progress of the past decade. And even then... is national sovereignty not preferable to minor economic gains?"
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "France has suffered from economic hardship and major terrorist attacks in Paris. The French people grow increasingly antagonistic to their Muslim and Jewish minorities. The Front National is looking at the possibility of perhaps take power in these troubled times. Will the democratic establishment and French European integration prevail? Or will France stand on her own like in the good old days?"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Germany, hit by the refugee crisis, economic hardship and growing internal resentment to countries like Greece, Italy and Spain, is still going strong. The European Union ever expands southwards. The European neighbors grew increasingly annoyed at Germany's policies. Is it worth it to continue that path? Or is it perhaps the time to revive border conflicts of old and let the soldiers march again?"

 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Japan is faced with the possibility of war each passing day, as Chinese naval vessels aggressively close into the Senkaku Islands and as North Korean missiles are launched into the stratosphere. Article 9 of the Japanese constitution has recently been amended to allow for a more active Japanese military abroad. This militaristic stance is unpopular with the people, but perhaps necessary to maintain national security."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "No country of the G7 and the great four of Europe has been so strongly affected by the economic crisis of 2008 like Italy has. Recovery is slow and government support dwindling. The influx of African migrants is not helping at giving the people the image of internal stability. Italy needs to consider her choices. Surely this is not the time to revive imperialism, but drastic reforms will be necessary..."
 PRC_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "China is very focused on not letting her enemies not her weaknesses. Pollution, internal migration problems, a dwindling standard in the military, the ever-corrupt governing body of the Communist Party. And yet, China is the giant of the east, the one that all the small countries fear. Japan, South Korea, the rebels in Taiwan, Vietnam... all of them united in their hatred for China. It is time for China to find a meaningful answer."
 RAJ_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "India's economy is rapidly growing, and so is its population. Still not greatly in the international spotlight, the Tiger is well-fed and growling. India is on the hunt, and its prey is ever-so unsuspecting."
 SPR_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Like other Southern European countries, Spain fell into an economic crisis in 2008, requiring economic stimuli from Northern European economies. Podemos and Ciudadanos have brought a new populism and new uncertainty to the old political system, while Catalonian independence movements are more threatening to Spanish unity than ever.\n\nEconomic Recovery will be a long and rocky path - will Spain stay with Europe and stick to the agreements that prevent immediate disaster - or is the future of Spain a different one from the future of Northern Europe?"
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Kicked out of the G8, faced with massive economic sanctions, struggling with maintaining its sphere of influence, but at least reunited with its brethren in Crimea. That sums up the situation of the Russian Federation since March 2014. With the West now greatly antagonistic to Russia, it must consider either apologizing and retreating into its internationally acknowledged territory or it must find new allies. Beijing comes to mind."

With the west now greatly antagonistic to Russia, it must consider either apologising and retreating into its internationally acknowledged territory or it must find new allies. Beijing comes to mind."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Internally more divided than ever before, externally more challenged than any time since the Cold War ended. The United States is not living in a national golden age for sure. People are wary of Chinese aggression, of industrial problems and economic hardship, public support for American military alliances is fading. The next president of the United States will have to redefine what it means to be the greatest nation on earth, the land of the free and the home of the brave."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Crimea, the Islamic State, North Korean nuclear weapons. With conflict ever growing, the minor nations of the world need to find a way to either preserve peace or to destroy their enemies as quickly as possible."
