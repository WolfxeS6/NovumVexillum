 austrian_neutrality_desc:0 "After seeing the partition of Germany into two states in 1949, the Austrians looked to prevent a division of their own nation at all costs. When Austria was founded from the former western allied and Soviet occupation zones in 1955, Austria made a promise to both sides to neither join the western or the eastern alliance, was however soon locked on the western side of the Iron Curtain.\n\nAustria's commitment to a full neutrality has however been questioned when Austria applied to join the EU in 1989 and eventually did in 1995. Thus, its neutrality is considered less total than the one of its Swiss neighbors."
 belgian_political_system:0 "Political System of Belgium"
 belgian_political_system_desc:0 "Belgium's political system is legendary for being overly complicated. The federal representative democratic constitutional monarchy of Belgium has a king as well as a central and national Belgian parliament (Brussels), a parliament for the Dutch-speaking Flemish community (Brussels), a parliament for the French-speaking Walloon community (Brussels), a parliament for the German-speaking community in the borderlands with Germany (Eupen), as well as a special designation for the officially bilingual capital city Brussels, the 'Capital Region', making Brussels the seat of three parliaments, but putting it ever so slightly out of the jurisdiction of the two regional ones and, of course, under the jurisdiction of its own Brussels parliament.\nAdd to that the subdivision into 10 provinces (not in Brussels though), 43 arrodissements and 589 municipalities and you have a thoroughly complicated and overly inefficient political system - that however succeeds in representing every single citizen sufficiently and thoroughly. Sometimes a bit too thoroughly maybe."

The CFA was linked with the French franc in the 20th century, and after the EURO system, the Euro and the exchange rate were changed to be linked with the Euro. and countries that use the CFA must keep 50% of their foreign assets in the French Treasury. This is used as a tool to strongly restrict former colonies from gaining economic independence.\n\nDe facto the CFA remains a symbol of economic imperialism in France. France is free to control the value of the CFA, so resources available at very low prices in their former colonies and maintaining French economic power in West Africa. However, as the 21st century approaches, it is doubtful that economic imperialism using the CFA franc will continue. African countries are increasingly agreeing that a new monetary system is needed to replace the CFA franc."

 ARG_ley_de_convertibilidad_desc:0 "Enacted in 1991 under President Carlos Menem, the Ley de Convertibilidad pegged the Argentine peso to the US dollar, aiming to curb hyperinflation and stabilize the economy. While the law brought initial success and brought down inflation rates, it also tied Argentina’s monetary policy to external forces, making the country vulnerable to global economic shifts."

 ARG_scars_of_the_dirty_war_desc:0 "From 1976 to 1983, Argentina endured a brutal military dictatorship known for its systemic human rights abuses during the period of the “Dirty War” (La Guerra Sucia). Thousands of Argentinians were kidnapped, tortured, and executed, their fates still unresolved for many families. The wounds of this dark chapter in the nation’s history continue to shape Argentine politics and society, where public trust in the army and government institutions remains fractured. While the democratic government post-1983 has worked toward justice and reconciliation, the emotional and psychological scars of the Dirty War persist, with unresolved trauma, political divisions, and contentious debates over accountability continuing to influence the national psyche."

 ARG_political_instability:0 "Political Instability"
 ARG_political_instability_desc:0 "At the turn of the millennium, Argentina's political landscape is marked by a pervasive sense of instability. Economic crises, corruption scandals, and a lack of faith in traditional political parties have left the country grappling with constant shifts in leadership and frequent protests. Argentina’s volatile political environment stems from a history of power struggles between the military, populist movements, and democratic governments. As politicians struggle to unite the population and address the country’s deepening issues, political instability threatens to undermine any attempts at lasting reform."
 ARG_legacy_of_the_malvinas:0 "Legacy of Las Malvinas"
 ARG_legacy_of_the_malvinas_desc:0 "The Islas Malvinas dispute remains a deeply ingrained part of Argentina's national identity. The failure to reclaim the islands in the 1982 war has left a profound mark on the collective psyche of the nation, fueling a sense of resentment and unresolved grievance. While most Argentineans long for peaceful resolution, the issue continues to affect diplomatic relations and foreign policy, particularly with the United Kingdom. The "Legacy of the Malvinas" also stirs nationalism and pride, with the conflict’s aftermath still playing a significant role in Argentina's internal politics."
