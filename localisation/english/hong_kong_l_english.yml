 hong_kong_news.1.desc:0 "This is not the first time that protests against the Chinese government have taken place in Hong Kong, but they have taken place on a much larger scale than ever before. The 'Umbrella Movement' originated from an umbrella brought by protesters to defend against tear gas by police. Protesters argue that the Chinese government is seriously undermining democracy in Hong Kong and that Hong Kong people should have "true" suffrage without Chinese intervention.\nProtesters are unarmed, and the protests are unlikely to last long as Hong Kong police decide to crack down hard. However, the world has learned that there are still many Hong Kong people who oppose the Chinese government."

A massive separatist demonstration took control of the Hong Kong government building today. Police supported separatists and refused to suppress the demonstrators, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong was arrested by protesters. Protesters officially declared \"Hong Kong as an independent country\" and [ENG.GetLeader] announced that he would guarantee independence for Hong Kong.
