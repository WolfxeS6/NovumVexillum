 congo.1.t:0 "Laurent Kabila's Child Soldiers"
 congo.1.d:0 "President Laurent-Désiré Kabila relies on a large body of child-soldier bodyguards, known as Kadogos, for his protection, with the DRC employing upwards of 10000 conscripted minors, comprising a significant percentage of our militias. This is being increasingly condemned by the international community, and, while one of the alleged main reasons for recruiting child soldiers is their supposed loyalty, many in government, including Kabila himself, are starting to suspect that the kadogos are involved in some kind of conspiracy against the president.\n So the question of the child soldiers remains: Should the kadogos be dismissed or are they still necessary for the war effort against Uganda and Rwanda?"
 congo.1.a:0 "They are still needed"
 congo.1.b:0 "This has gone too far, dismiss them"
 congo.2.t:0 "The Assassination of Laurent-Désiré Kabila"
 congo.2.d:0 "Laurent-Désiré Kabila, president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was assassinated in his office inside his official residence at the Palais de Marbre, Kinshasa. The assassin was an 18-year-old boy soldier, a kadogo, and there are strong indications that the murder was the result of a conspiracy by the kadogos. Laurent's son, Joseph Kabila succeeded his father to the presidency at the young age of 29."
 congo.2.a:0 "This is Horrible"
 congo.3.t:0 "An opportunity for peace"
 congo.3.d:0 "The death of Kabila, tragic as it was, created an opportunity for an end to this bloody war. The Rwandan and Ugandan militaries shall leave Congolese territory, and the rebel groups they support shall disarm and join a Transitional Government until free democratic elections are held. Our government will also try to dismantle the Interahamwe and other Hutu-supremacist militias operating in our territory."

 congo.4.t:0 "The DRC offers peace"
 congo.4.d:0 "The death of Laurent Kabila means that calmer heads are now leading the DRC. They've approached our government with a peace proposal: our forces shall leave Congolese territory, and the rebel groups we support shall disarm and join a Transitional Government until free democratic elections are held. The DRC also promised to try to dismantle the Interahamwe and other Hutu-supremacist militias operating in our territory."

 congo.5.t:0 "Revolt against Wamba Dia Wamba"
 congo.5.d:0 "After the defeat against Rwandan and RCD-Goma forces in the recent skirmishes, internal revolt and instability rocked the RCD-Kinsangani leadership. Professor Wamba Dia Wamba, after seeing his position collapse and surviving multiple assassination attempts, was ousted by Antipas Mbusa Nyamwisi, who renamed the movement as \"Rally for Congolese Democracy - Kisangani - Movement for Liberation\". Wamba fled the capital and found a splinter faction with his supporters, but he's become militarily irrelevant."
 congo.5.a:0 "Stability is in short supply in the Congo"

 congo.7.d:0 "Kabila's regime in Kinshasa is no more. We achieved victory in the struggle against the Congolese dictator, but the war is far from over, as multiple rebel factions now control different parts of the country, and only one will achieve supremacy over the rest and be recognized as the rightful successor to the Democratic Republic of the Congo."

 congo.13.d:0 "The peace process of the Second Congo war isn't going smoothly. As enemy rebel forces disarm and DRC forces move into the Kivu region in Eastern Congo to crush the radical Hutu FDLR militias, former RCD military commanders, chief among them Laurent Nkunda, refused to accept the peace terms and formed the National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP), launching an insurgency in the region, probably with assistance from their former benefactors, the Rwandans."

 congo.14.d:0 "Our victory in the Second Congo War didn't mean the end of hostilities in the Congo. Cornered, the radical Hutu militias of the FDLR, remnants of the Interahamwe responsible for the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, have risen against us and our puppet regime in Kinshasa."

 congo.15.d:0 "Previously dormant land disputes between two ethnic groups in the Ituri region, the Hema and Lendu, have flared up once again after the instability of the recent leadership change in the RCD/K-ML. While the conflict was previously seen in the region in 1999, it had temporarily ceased, but the peace is now broken, and bloodshed returns."
 congo.15.a:0 "This is getting ugly"
 congo.16.t:0 "Flag Change"
 congo.16.d:0 "A minor change was proposed to the national flag. A blue field with a small yellow star, situated in the top corner of the hoist side, with a red, yellow-lined band running diagonally across the center. While the blue field with a yellow star has been a symbol of the Congo since the days of Leopold II, this flag was resignified so that the red symbolized the people's blood; the yellow symbolized prosperity; the blue symbolized hope; and the star represented unity. A design very similar to the proposed one was used after the Congo Crisis, from roughly 1993 to 1971, when Mobutu renamed the country Zaire"
 congo.16.a:0 "Let's adopt it!"

Next in line of succession is the vice-president, General Paul Kagame. While many argue that Kagame was already de-facto ruler of the country, his swearing-in as president will no doubt start a new age in Rwandan history"
 rwanda.1.a:0 "Understood"
 rwanda.2.t:0 "Strike at Uganda?"
 rwanda.2.d:0 "The city of Kinsangani is of major strategic importance in the current war. While it's currently under our control, being occupied by forces of the RDC-Goma, the Ugandans and their puppets in the RCD-Kinsangani, who originally controlled the city, have eyes on the city like vultures surrounding their prey. One solution for this issue is a preemptive strike against Ugandan and RCD-K forces in the region, a risky plan, but if we come out of the conflict victorious the Ugandans will have a hard time consting our supremacy in the Congo."

In the summer of 2006, the ICU expelled an alliance of Somali warlords from Mogadishu, becoming the first organization to consolidate control over all of the city since the collapse of the state in 1991.
