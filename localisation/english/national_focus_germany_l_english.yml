The unification aims to consolidate the far-right forces, pooling resources and membership under the more prominent NPD name. NPD Chairman Udo Voigt stated, "Together, we will be stronger and better equipped to fight for our ideals and represent our supporters." The merger has sparked controversy, with critics warning of a more organized far-right presence in German politics.

Key leaders, including Lothar Bisky from the PDS and Oskar Lafontaine from the WASG, expressed optimism about the merger's potential to strengthen opposition against centrist and right-wing parties. The new party aims to advocate more effectively for workers' rights, social justice, and a fairer economic system.

Key figures in the party emphasize the need for a robust response to neoliberal policies and austerity measures, advocating for greater social welfare and equitable economic policies. The WASG's platform focuses on improving labor conditions, increasing social security, and promoting fair wages. The party's founders believe that their mission resonates with a growing segment of the population seeking more comprehensive social justice and economic reforms. As the WASG begins its political journey, it aims to attract voters looking for a strong alternative to traditional parties, potentially reshaping the future of Germany's political and social landscape."
