 nvx_oracle_ai_help.0.d:0 "Fourth estates are ideological popularities which shift naturally over time. They represent news media companies or state-funded propaganda outlets. If an ideology loses favor for an extended period, the respective estate will shrink. The opposite is true. These can be altered directly with authoritarian and censorship decisions, or by aberrant events. Aberrant shifts are seemingly random, but the inner machinations are constantly changing.\n\nFifth estates represent local and online political activists acting in support of an ideology not represented by their country’s media. Their influence is much smaller than fourth estates, but they pose different threats and may be elusive."

It can be expended on certain actions, such as interacting with estates. If it comes within specific thresholds, which may be seen on the five different economic statuses, the economic status of a country will change.\n\nEconomic Growth comes from low taxes or specific policies. It can be reduced by high taxes or other policies. This demonstrates actions that hurt the economy of the country. Growth is calculated every month and moderate taxes will always slowly bring Economic Health to zero."

The latent effects are rather broad; however, the presented modifiers are more specific. Every level above undeveloped cumulatively adds +1 to the Indenture Project capacity.\nThe Economic Freedom Index is a value which represents how free the market is in a country. It’s a simple ratio of the number of Private Industry factories divided by the total number of civilian factories. An excess of military factories is factored in once the ratio of military to civilian factories is higher than 1:5.\nA higher EFI increases the frequency of beneficial economic events."
 nvx_oracle_ai_help.104.d:0 "The economy status is determined by the inherent economic growth of a country. It is automatically changed once the situation demands it.\nEconomic Value is a multiplier of most internal economic systems. Essentially, it scales the value of each economic component relative to other countries. E.g. One factory in Mali is not as valuable as one in Germany. EV grows or falls per month based on events, decisions, and various systems.\nHere you will also find the projected GDP for the current year, last year’s GDP, and last year’s average monthly GDP (MGDP)."
 nvx_oracle_ai_help.105.d:0 "The income tax rate is the percentage of standard factory revenue which goes to the government.\nThe corporate tax rate is decided by both the Tax Rate and Trade Policy. This value is applied to all factories and is scaled by the Economic Freedom Index. Read into the income tutorials and descriptions for more information.\nTaxes will be reduced when stability is under 50%. This will increase linearly up to -50% at 0% stability.\nExtreme taxes will reduce the Economic Value of a country by 0.1% per month, while meager taxes will increase the EV of a country by 0.1% per month."

 nvx_oracle_ai_help.302.d:0 "A Project is a single building ordered in an Indenture. Indentures may only contain Projects for the same building type. Cost and construction speed are based on the type of building."

 nvx_oracle_ai_help.304.d:0 "The maximum number of shared building Projects which may be included in a single Indenture is determined by the nation’s development level, contracts, and special events. State buildings, such as infrastructure, have no limit aside from the maximum capacity of the state."
 nvx_oracle_ai_help.305.d:0 "When one Project is finished, and there are more to come in the Indenture, another is begun with new time calculations. This means that large Indentures will continually calculate time to complete based on the new time calculations. Building speed is affected by all traditional speed bonuses, such as techs. Building on non-core states increases build time by 40%."
 nvx_oracle_ai_help.306.d:0 "Contracts are single-use modifiers for Indentures. A contract applies to all Projects ordered within a single Indenture. These can range from lowered costs to increased Project capacity for the Indenture itself.

These events increase in frequency in relation to how high a nation’s Economic Freedom Index value is. Ongoing wars decrease event frequency."

 nvx_oracle_ai_help.403.d:0 "This is event is triggered when declaring war. It cannot be activated manually. It will trigger randomly while at war, becoming more frequent the closer to surrendering a nation is.\n\nThis event will generate either Main Battle Tanks or Multirole Fighters, depending on the option taken. The number of tanks is based on the number of active MBT battalions, and the number of Fighters is based on the number of owned states and active Anti-Air battalions. The vehicles given are always one tech level outdated. Both are reduced by higher counts of owned factories over 20."
 nvx_oracle_ai_help.500.t:0 "Capricious Wars"
 nvx_oracle_ai_help.500.d:0 "Capricious Wars are created by semi-random events by generating war goals against neighbor countries. Every country has the potential to generate these goals. Certain attributes make it more or less likely, such as ideology and national development. More warlike ideologies will more often get these events whereas developing nations are less likely and developed nations even more so.\n\nDifferent ideologies will also generate different types of war goals. For instance, Islamists and communists are more likely to gain puppet goals whereas fascists and nationalists are more likely to gain conquest goals. Developed democracies will more often flip governments.\n\nOther factors will make it nearly impossible for a war goal to be created. Being in the same faction, both countries being majors, and being in a defensive war will prevent these war goals. The decision in Pulling the Strings to intensify these wars will remove most of the restrictions. These events can also be totally disabled by a decision."

 ### URUGUAY ###
 uruguay.6.t:0 "Military Attempts Coup"
 uruguay.6.d:0 "With Uruguay’s economy in freefall, unemployment at record highs, and mass protests sweeping across the nation, the civilian government has lost all control. Citing the need for national stability, the Armed Forces have intervened, dissolving the legislature and imposing martial law. Tanks roll through Montevideo as the people wake up to the news: democracy is no more. \n\nAt the head of this military junta is General Ángel Bertolotti, who promises to restore order, rebuild the economy, and purge the nation of 'corrupt politicians and radicals.'"
 uruguay.6.a:0 "For the good of the nation, we accept military rule."
 uruguay.6.b:0 "We fought them once, we'll fight them again."

 uruguay.7.t:0 "The Streets Roar"
 uruguay.7.d:0 "The military junta's iron grip has only poured fuel on the flames of resistance. Despite tanks patrolling Montevideo and nightly curfews, the people have risen in numbers unseen since the darkest days of dictatorship. \n\nThe protests now dwarf even the historic Acto del Obelisco of 1983, with Montevideo's avenues choked by millions demanding democracy. Students, unionists, and pensioners alike chant ¡Nunca Más! as General Bertolotti's tanks face down human waves armed with nothing but flags and defiance. But unity among the opposition is fragile-some seek compromise, others revolution, and the junta's response will determine whether Uruguay drowns in blood or rebirths itself in fire."
