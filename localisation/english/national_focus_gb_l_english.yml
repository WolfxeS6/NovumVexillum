As part of Operation Trident he was stopped at 6:15pm while in a minicab, he ran out of the taxi and pulled out a handgun. Debate has emerged over whether the gangster was warned before he was shot however he was killed during the altercation."

Looting is widespread with the police having to draft in riot police from other areas. The situation has been made worse by looters organising with BBM (Black Berry Messanger) to coordinate, with many members having travelled to take part in the looting."
