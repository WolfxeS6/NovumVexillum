 USA_reduce_market_regulations:0 "Reduce Market Regulations"
 USA_reduce_market_regulations_desc:0 "The free market is a cornerstone of the American model, and should remain that way. The economy thrives when it is led by the invisible hand of the market, rather than the clenched fist of the government."

 USA_create_jobs_on_the_west_coast_desc:0 "Even though the West Coast is only home to less than 20% of our citizens, it has seen enormous growth, with cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle becoming core metropolitan areas.

 USA_military_production_centralization_reform_desc:0 "It may be time to strengthen our hold on the industry in order to benefit our military production. To do this, we'll need to centralise, possibly even federalize, as much of the military industry as we can conceivably manage."
 USA_expand_the_monetary_control_act:0 "Expand the Monetary Control Act"
 USA_expand_the_monetary_control_act_desc:0 "The Monetary Control Act was part of an Act passed in 1980, which opened the discount window for the Fed enabling a host of financial institutions to borrow from the Federal Reserve.

 USA_resource_production_in_alaska:0 "Resource Production in Alaska"
 USA_resource_production_in_alaska_desc:0 "Alaska may be cold and inhospitable to any but the most determined Alaskans, but its underground contains a wealth of natural resources that are ripe for the taking.

 USA_build_additional_steel_factories:0 "Build additional Steel Factories"

 USA_revive_the_rust_belt_desc:0 "The vast areas of what was once known as the Steel Belt have for several decades languished due to loss of jobs, loss of population and overall loss of hope, as the industries have largely moved out and left behind a disillusioned and poor populace. If any part of our country could benefit from a boost to industrial growth, this is the place."
 USA_strengthen_the_military_industrial_complex:0 "Strengthen the Military-Industrial Complex"
 USA_strengthen_the_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "There are those who claim that the Military-Industrial Complex is an opaque cabal of unscrupulous businessmen who profit on the deaths of millions of innocent people. And then there are those that view them as an excellent business partner."
 USA_factory_worker_rights:0 "Factory Worker Rights"
 USA_factory_worker_rights_desc:0 "Regardless of what one may think about socialism, it's right in caring about the worker. While we may not want to part with the means of production, we can at the very least extend some basic rights to the workers in order to ensure a happy and stable workforce in the factories."
 USA_dodd_frank_plan:0 "Dodd-Frank Plan"
 USA_dodd_frank_plan_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, economic recession is looming.

 USA_chromium_and_tungsten_production:0 "Chromium and Tungsten Production"
 USA_chromium_and_tungsten_production_desc:0 "Chromium and tungsten both have important military applications, but neither are found naturally in the American underground.

 USA_encourage_growth_in_the_rust_belt:0 "Encourage Growth in the Rust Belt"

 USA_encourage_growth_in_the_rocky_mountains_desc:0 "The Rocky Mountains may not exactly be the first choice of any strapping young entrepreneur looking to start the next runaway success. If we wish to remedy that, we need to at the very least make room for new industries to grow."
 USA_encourage_growth_in_the_american_south:0 "Encourage Growth in the American South"
 USA_encourage_growth_in_the_american_south_desc:0 "The South was never the most financially successful part of the United States, but by the late 20th century, their service sector, manufacturing base and energy industry seemed to grow almost exponentially. If we want to keep up this momentum in the new millennium, we'll need to ensure that the budding industries have room to expand."

 USA_revive_indiana_desc:0 "The self-proclaimed Hoosier State admittedly handled the Rust Belt situation better than many of its neighbours, but the steel production in the Calumet region is still far lower than expected. We need to rectify this."
 USA_revive_michigan:0 "Revive Michigan"
 USA_revive_michigan_desc:0 "Michigan used to be known as the centre of the automotive industry, but the state today is a husk of its former self, with cities such as Detroit struggling under a stagnant economy. If we were to bring the steel industry back to Michigan, it would go a long way towards reinvigorating the entirety of the Great Lakes State."
 USA_civilian_industry_rocky_mountains:0 "Civilian Industry: Rocky Mountains"
 USA_civilian_industry_rocky_mountains_desc:0 "To an outsider, the Rocky Mountains may seem like an odd place for an industrial hub. We may need to financially support a few pioneers in order to really get the ball rolling."
 USA_civilian_industry_midwest:0 "Civilian Industry: Midwest"
 USA_civilian_industry_midwest_desc:0 "The Midwest may not have the flashy style of Hollywood or the fast-talking business magnates of New York City, but it has honest, dependable and hard-working people. It's time to expand our industrial capacity into the Midwestern states."
