 usa.1.d:0 "On September 11th, 2001, four planes were abducted by terrorists of the Al-Qaeda network. The hijackers used the commercial airliners American Airlines Flight 11, United Airlines Flight 175, American Airlines Flight 77 and United Airlines Flight 93 as flying bombs against the United States. \n\nOn September 11th, 2001, at 8:46 AM, Flight 11 hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City, shortly followed by Flight 175 hitting the South Tower at 9:03 AM. At 9:37 AM, Flight 77 hit the Pentagon in Washington D.C., and at 10:03 AM, Flight 93 crashed after the passengers attempted to take back the plane from the terrorists, causing the plane to not reach its intended target, which likely also was Washington D.C..\n\nOur nation has to recover from a horrifying day. The political situation is completely different from what it was yesterday."

These reports were also confirmed even by five on-duty police officers across the region.\n\nThe aircraft, which made no sound and was reportedly massive in size, operated at treetop level altitude and was spotted several times between 4:00 and 5:00 in the morning.\n\nThe incident has once more funneled conspiracy theories about secret U.S. Air Force projects or, depending on the conspiracy theorist, an alien invasion or alien control of several world leaders, including the U.S. President [USA.GetLeader]."

 usa.4.d:0 "The massive American computer technology giant Microsoft has steadily expanded ever since its founding in 1975. Microsoft, especially dominant in the home computer markets with its Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 98 operating systems, is always looking to broaden its outreach and the amount of computer programs it controls, arguably so that they can no longer be released on non-Microsoft operating systems.\n\nOne such target for expansion is the Seattle-based Visio Corporation, whose acquisition by Microsoft was initially announced in September of 1999. Visio, which is to become the Visio Division within the Microsoft Business Productivity Group, has especially met appraisal for its programs to generate charts, graphs and other data visualisation for corporate administrators, economic experts and product designers. Microsoft, which is paying 1.5 billion U.S. Dollars for the acquisition which is to be finalized on January 7th, 2000, hopes to strengthen its standing with professionals through the annexation of Visio."

 usa.7.d:0 "Today, the Attorney General of the United States, Janet Reno, will have to come to a decision in regards to the fate of young Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez.\n\nGonzalez is currently residing in Florida with relatives, after he survived the dangerous escape from Cuba to the United States - an escape during which his mother tragically died. However, the mother tried not only to flee from communism, but also from her husband, Gonzalez' father, who, still back in Cuba, now made demands to have the boy come back to him. \n\nThere can be no doubt from both an American and a Cuban standpoint that it would follow the law to send the young boy back to his father. But there are both moral and political implications here. Should we doom a young man to communistic oppression? Should we jeopardize the Cuban support for the Democratic Party in the vital key state of Florida? \n\nIt all comes down to Reno's verdict now."

 usa.10.d:0 "The death of comic legend Charles M. Schulz on February 12th, 2000, marked the end of a legend and the end of an era. The Minneapolis-born comic artist had drawn the "Peanuts" comic sketches for over 50 years, as well as most of the movie and television scripts of his comic children around Charlie Brown. In total more than 17,800 unique comics, "The Peanuts" was the longest-running comic series of all time. One day after the death of its creator, the last original Peanuts comic was published in the Sunday newspapers.\n\nThe death of Schulz leaves comic fans and avid newspaper readers alike mourning the country over. The comic series will not be continued in accordance with Schulz's wishes - but at 17,800 comics, there is pretty of rerunning that newspapers will be able to do."

The older gentleman of Jewish-Polish descent and long-time independent member of the Senate (even though backed by the Democratic Party) is outspoken against American Imperialism and about the dominance of the wealthy over the unfortunate.\n\nIn times like these, populists seem viable.

But that is exactly what happened: With several severe and sweeping changes to the rights of states, all American states have been turned into monarchies under authoritarian dukes - and these United Duchies also managed to abolish the Supreme Court, the House of Representatives and the Office of President, uniting all powers in the Senate - which is now controlled by not two senators per state, but by one 'Imperial Legate', handpicked by the respective duke. The United Duchies operate under the concept of 'The Vote of 30', where at least 30 legates have to agree to exercise the otherwise unchecked power of this new self-proclaimed 'Grand Council'."

Those who harbor terrorists, or who finance them, are going to pay a price.".\n\nThe Democrats up and down the country have begun rallying around Clinton's statements, signalling not only solidarity with their senator but also with the Republican administration to proceed and to take up any means necessary to find a proper answer to this not only atrocious, but fundamentally anti-American attack."

Karzai, initially a supporter of the Taliban government, started opposing their increasingly fascistic authoritarianism from 1996 onwards and fled to a United Nations embassy. In Pakistani Quetta, he founded an anti-Taliban force together with his father and brother in 1997. He funded and armed Northern Alliance forces and sent financial support to Taliban victims and resistance forces within Afghanistan, all the while getting in contact with CIA operatives.\n\nIn 1999, Karzai's father, the Khan of the Pashtun Popalzai people, was assassinated by the Taliban in an attack which Karzai himself, now Khan, barely survived.

Every single state has grown in population, however the District of Columbia has seen a population decrease of 34,000.\nThe population, by ethnic self-classification, is 75% white, 12% Hispanic, 12% black and 3% Asian. The largest group by descent from a single country are, as is custom for decades, the German Americans at about 12.4% of the population.\nThe census did not gather religious data (in accordance with the secular nature of the U.S. as per the First Amendment), however religion did play a role in the so-called "Utah Controversy", when the state of Utah, which failed to gain a fourth congressional seat by a margin of 80 people, tried to have most Mormons outside of Utah count as Utahns in order to gain the seat that now was given to North Carolina.

Bush had lost in 2000, he pulled out of politics and rejoined the oil industry in Texas. In his place, the Republican Party nominated Newt Gingrich, a fundamentalist right-winger who was supposed to appeal to the people on a more ideological base than Bush had. The Democrats meanwhile had no real opposition. While both former First Lady Hillary Clinton and a young African American senator from Illinois had thought about running a campaign, it was clear that the party stood united behind Al Gore, who is favorite to win against Gingrich."

 election_USA.3.d:0 "After several government crises and conflicts, the Democratic Party wanted a new face that would lead the party into a new age of popularity with young people, ethnic minorities and women; all population groups that traditionally were not drawn towards the Republican Party anyway. This new face came in the shape of Illinois Senator Barack Hussein Obama, who won the primary contests against Bill Clinton's wife and former First Lady Hillary Clinton. The Republican contests were also fierce, with the hardline faction finally losing out to the moderate fiscal conservatives around Vietnam veteran John McCain. \n\nOn election night, it seems like the Democrats, whose election slogan 'Yes, we can!' is heard across the country, might have the edge by as many as ten million votes. But who knows who could win?"

 election_USA.4.d:0 "After a relatively satisfying first term in office, it was quite clear that the Democratic Party would stand behind its incumbent president Barack Obama for the 2012 Presidential Election. The Republican Party had to readjust after the gamble to mix radical and moderate Republicans had failed with the McCain-Palin ticket of 2008.\n\nThe Republicans went through a primary process with many voters from many parts of the Republican Party, from strict Christians like Rick Santorum to Rick Perry to libertarian approaches like the one of Ron Paul. The GOP in the end chose Mitt Romney, a former Mormon missionary and current Governor of Massachusetts.\n\nLike with the last election, Obama seems to have the edge with young people and minorities, which in theory should make him easily win - but in the end, it comes down to a good strategy and a bit of luck."

 election_USA.5.t:0 "Election of 2016"
 election_USA.5.d1:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 might have been one of the most heated and ideologically charged political showdowns of the 21st Century. The Election was, in the best style of American democracy, not decided by committed supporters of either side, but by regular people who found the candidate they did not vote for unbearable as president. \n\nSucceeding a strong eight years under a democratic government, the Democratic Party quickly fell into a two-candidate battle between declared Democratic Socialist and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders on one side, and former First Lady and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on the other. Clinton, although accused of corruption and overly friendly stances towards international companies, managed to beat Sanders with a mix of party corruption and a strong support base in the more conservative states in the south and center of the country. \n\nThe Republicans meanwhile found themselves unable to quickly designate a front runner, with more than a dozen candidates initially running. After eliminating his competitors John Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, reality show star and billionaire Donald Trump won with aggressive rhetoric and with a style of providing simple answers to complicated questions. \n\nThe disapproval ratings for both candidates pass 50% of the populous. Neither party finds anything appealing about the other candidate. Both rational and widely popular candidates have failed. It has come down to one final question - A woman deeply involved with big business and shady dealings or a man regularly publishing neo-fascist propaganda on social media?"
 election_USA.5.d2:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 has become a battle of two wings of populism.\n\nAfter the Democratic Nomination had been a close race that once more ended up seeing Hillary Clinton as the loser, as before in 2008; the Republican race quickly had become dominated by a far-right rhetoric battle between Donald Trump and similar-minded contestants like Ted Cruz and Ben Carson.\n\nNow, both candidates promise to battle Wall Street influences and to give back America to the people. Who will it be? The independent senator, legend among left-wing progressives, from small Vermont, Bernie Sanders; or the successful and famous businessman from New York City, Donald Trump?"
 election_USA.5.d3:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 has been described as the 'battle of the sleeper agents' by a far-left online commentator. Both Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz, the two major candidates, are hugely unpopular and are booed by wings of their own party for their uncharismatic behavior. Both the \"Sanders Progressives\" and the \"Trump Nationalists\" hate their party's candidate and are looking into alternatives, like the Greens, the Libertarians and the Constitutionalists. Who will it be among the 'sleeper agents' then? Cruz or Clinton?"
 election_USA.5.d4:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 has been a lopsided affair, comparable to the Reagan, Nixon and Roosevelt landslides. Where the Democrats managed to bring a hugely popular progressive candidate, Bernie Sanders, into the mix; the Republicans failed to nominate a unifying candidate and went with Ted Cruz - a man that was described with flattering words like 'vindictive', 'straight-up evil' or 'the anti christ' even among fellow conservatives for his behavior of flip-flopping.\n\nThe polls are clear, Sanders is favored by a near 10% edge - but the electoral college is known to be a mischievous mistress. Can Cruz win?"
 election_USA.5.d5:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 has been titled 'battle of sociopaths' by left-wing TV host Bill Maher. Indeed it seems that both Republican candidate Marco Rubio and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton are unpopular, uncharismatic and pragmatic - but no one doubts that both of them have a certain talent as politicians.\n\nSo, which uninspiring, uncharismatic sociopath will it be? Marco Rubio from Florida or Hillary Clinton from New York?"
 election_USA.5.d6:0 "'I have never witnessed such a weak political performance, and that is saying something', neo-nazi leader Richard Spencer wrote about the first debate of the 2016 US Presidential Election.\n\nIndeed, there is not much to be had for far-right voters when looking at the battle of two moderates, comparable to the 1992 election between Clinton and Bush Sr.\n\nThis time, Democratic candidate for nomination Clinton - but the female one - failed to overcome a far-left challenger in the form of Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nSanders and Rubio, apart from the far right criticism, have both been praised by the media for their respective campaigns that very much focussed on issues rather than mudslinging. 'If this holds up, we might actually restore a political discourse', Bill O'Reilly commented on the election race.\n\nSo, who will it be?"
 election_USA.5.d7:0 "'Kasich versus Clinton. If that sounds boring, wait until you see it.', TV show host Bill Maher snarked at the candidates the two major political parties chose.\n\nThe US Presidential Election of 2016 has been a shock to both far left and far right voters. Both campaigns have super moderate candidates, both campaigns have largely abstained from mudslinging moves, and both campaigns have been described as being lead by 'corrupt kleptocrats' by an MSNBC commentator.\n\nThat sounds demotivating, but one these needs to be president. So let's go for it! Who will it be? Clinton or Kasich?"
 election_USA.5.d8:0 "'This had to have been the most left-wing campaigns I ever saw in my life, it's horrible', Ann Coulter complained on Fox News about the second Presidential Debate of the 2016 US Election.\n\nA far-left Democrat, Bernie Sanders, meets a very moderate fiscal Republican, John Kasich, in the arena of the longest and most expensive election of not only American but also world history.\n\nSanders slashed Kasich, the governor of Ohio, for his stance on Planned Parenthood and his cowardly mannerisms when dealing with big business, while Kasich called Vermont senator Sanders out for the very extended gun rights in his home state, thus making Sanders' gun control platform one of hipocrisy.\n\n'This campaign has been highly productive and interesting', a British foreign policy observer commented on the BBC. The global and internal interest is now reaching its peak on election day. Who will win?"

The joint resolution was approved by the House last evening and the Senate followed suit early this morning. The congressional vote endorsing the resolution on Iraq is seen as a solid endorsement that the President will work with the United Nations if possible, or alone, if necessary, to disarm Saddam Hussein of his weapons of mass destruction."

 usa.72.d:0 "The United States offered intelligence to the Security Council suggesting that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. While no evidence has been found yet, there is still suspicion that Saddam possessed them. It's been well documented that Hussein used chemical weapons in the past, including attacks against civilians. Given Hussein's reputation for supporting terrorists as well as possible links to Al-Qaeda, plans have been drawn up for an invasion of Iraq. The plan is to first end the regime of Saddam Hussein. Second, to identify, isolate, and eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Third, to capture and drive terrorists out of the country as well as secure the Iraqi oilfields. Fourth, to collect as much intelligence as we can to relate to terrorist networks and the global network of illicit WMDs. And last, to help the Iraqi people create conditions for a transition to representative self-government while providing humanitarian support to the displaced and many needy Iraqi citizens. §YInvasion units will eventually be deleted§!."

The U.S.-led campaign aims at ridding Iraq of its dictator, Saddam Hussein, and eliminating its ability to store, develop, and deploy its stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. The strike comes just days after Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein defied a 48-hour deadline to leave the country. In response to the military invasion, the Republic of Iraq Radio in Baghdad said "The evil ones, the enemies of God, the homeland and humanity, have committed the stupid aggression against our homeland and people.". Meanwhile, US military sources have said that five key members of the Iraqi regime, including Saddam Hussein, were targeted in the first attacks."

The scene in central Baghdad, where Iraqi citizens and American marines collaborated in toppling a huge statue of Saddam Hussein, signaled that a complete American military victory in Iraq may be achieved within a matter of days, not months, although there may still be some difficult combat ahead in outlying Baghdad neighborhoods and areas north of the capital, including Hussein's hometown of Tikrit. No one knows whether Hussein and his two sons are alive or dead, but the fall of Baghdad suggests that organized resistance to the invading forces could subside now that the centralized institutions of power in Iraq have been shattered."

The arrest comes within months after U.S. troops swept into the Iraqi capital, and brings an end to one of the most intensive manhunts in history. In a televised address this afternoon, the U.S. President, [USA.GetLeader] said that Saddam would face "the justice he denied to millions". He said that the former Iraqi leader's arrest "marks the end of the road for him and all who bullied and killed in his name".

The final column of around 100 mostly U.S. military MRAP armoured vehicles carrying 500 U.S. troops trundled across the southern Iraq desert from their last base through the night and daybreak along an empty highway to the Kuwaiti border. For the United States, the military pullout is the fulfillment of a promise to bring troops home from a conflict, widely considered the most unpopular war since Vietnam and one that tainted America’s standing worldwide. For Iraqis, though, the departure brings a sense of sovereignty tempered by nagging fears their country may slide once again into the kind of sectarian violence that killed many thousands of people at its peak in 2006-2007."
